<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The purpose of this volume is not the addition of one more to
the numerous treatises upon sylviculture or forestry, but to afford
a straightforward means for the identification of our native trees
and larger shrubs for the convenience of the rural rambler and
Nature-lover. The list of British arborescent plants is a somewhat
meagre one, but all that could be done in a pocket volume
by way of supplementing it has been done&mdash;by adding some
account of those exotics that have long been naturalized in our
woods, and a few of more recent introduction that have already
become conspicuous ornaments in many public and private
parks.</p>

<p>In this edition forty-eight extra plates have been added, of
which twenty-four are in colours. The latter are in part reproductions
of water-colour studies of flowers and fruits, and partly
from photographs by a new method. For the black and white
plates, the photographs, it should be explained, have been taken
upon a novel plan in most cases. This consists in photographing
a deciduous tree in its summer glory, and returning to the
same spot in winter and photographing the same individual, so
that a striking comparison may be made between the summer<!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and winter aspects of the principal species. Supplementary
photographs are given, in many cases, of the bole, which exhibit
the character of the bark, and should prove a valuable aid in
the identification of species. Others show in larger detail the
flowers or fruit, and the characteristic leaf-buds in spring.</p>

<p>The figures in the text have all been expressly drawn for the
work with a view to showing at a glance the general character
of the foliage, and in most cases the flower and fruit.</p>

<p>The work is divided into two sections. <a href="#PART_I">Part I</a>. including
those species that are generally considered to be indigenous
to the British Islands, with briefer notices of the introduced
species that are closely related to them. <a href="#PART_II">Part II</a>. being devoted
to those of foreign origin, some of them introduced so long ago
that they are commonly regarded as native by those who are
not botanists.<!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY"></a>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>


<p>There are two points of view from which to regard trees&mdash;the
mercantile and the &aelig;sthetic. The former is well exemplified in
Dumbiedyke's advice to Jock: "Jock, when ye hae naething else
to do, ye may be aye sticking in a tree; it will be growing, Jock,
when ye're sleeping." The canny Scot was thinking of the "unearned
increment" another generation might gather in, due
to the almost unceasing activity of the vegetable cells in the
manufacture of timber. The other view was expressed by "the
Autocrat of the Breakfast-table" in a letter to a friend: "Whenever
we plant a tree we are doing what we can to make our
planet a more wholesome and happier dwelling-place for those
who come after us, if not for ourselves." But, after all, it is the
trees that have been planted by Nature that give the greatest
pleasure apart from commercial considerations&mdash;the lonely
Pine, that grows in rugged grandeur on the edge of the escarpment
where its seed was planted in the crevice by the wind;
the Oak that grows outside the forest, where a squirrel or a jay
dropped the acorn, and where the young tree had room all its
life to throw out its arms as it would; the little cluster of Birches
that springs from the ferns and moss of the hillside. All trees
so grown develop an individuality that is not apparent in their
fellows of the timber forest; and however we may delight in
the peace and quiet of the forest, with its softened light and
cool fragrant air, we can there only regard the trees in a mass.<!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
We might, indeed, reverse the old saying, and declare that we
cannot see the trees on account of the wood.</p>

<p>Nature and the timber-producer have different aims and pursue
different methods in the making of forests, though the latter
is not above taking a hint from the former occasionally. Nature
mixes her seeds and sows them broadcast over the land she
intends to turn into forest, that the more vigorous kinds may act
as nurses, sheltering and protecting the less robust. Then comes
the struggle for existence, with its final ending in the survival of
the fittest. In the mean time the mixed forest has given shelter
to an enormous population of smaller fry&mdash;plants, mammals,
birds, and insects&mdash;and has been a delightful recreation ground
for man. The timber-producer aims at so controlling the struggle
for existence that the survival of the fit is maintained from
start to finish. He plants his young trees in regular order,
putting in nurses at intervals and along the borders, intending
to cut them down when his purpose has been served. The timber
trees are allowed no elbow-room, the putting forth of lateral
branches is discouraged, but steady upward growth and the
production of "canopy" is abetted. His aim is to get these
timber-sticks as near alike as possible, free from individuality,
and with the minimum of difference in girth at top and bottom
of each pole. This means a thicker and longer balk of clean
timber when the tree is felled and squared. The continuous
canopy induces growth in the upward direction only, and discourages
the weeds and undergrowth that add to the charm of
the forest, but which unprofitably use up the wood-producing
elements in the soil. This plan contrasts strongly with the
views on planting formerly prevalent in this country, John
Evelyn, for example, making a special point of giving the Oak
room to stretch out its arms, "free from all incumbrances." But,
then, unlike the timber-producers, Evelyn had an eye for landscape
beauty, and giving an opportunity for the display of such
beauty. He says: "And if thus his Majesty's forests and chases<!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
were stored, viz. with this spreading tree at handsome intervals,
by which grazing might be improved for the feeding of deer
and cattle under them (for such was the old Saltus), being only
visited with the gleams of the sun, and adorned with the distant
landscapes appearing through the glades and frequent valleys,
nothing could be more ravishing."</p>

<p>The greater the success of the forester, the more profound
is the solemn stillness of the forest&mdash;and the more
monotonous. In place of the natural forest, with its varied
and teeming life, we have what Wordsworth called a timber
factory. In the natural forest, with its mixture of many kinds
of trees, the undergrowth of shrubs, and carpet of grass and
weeds, the stronger trees spread out their arms in all
directions, and fritter away (as the scientific forester would
say) their wood-producing powers in making much firewood
and little valuable timber. But the result is very beautiful,
and the nature-lover can wander among it without tiring, and
can study without exhausting its treasures. Emerson says: "In
the woods is perpetual youth. Within these plantations of God
a decorum and sanctity reign, a perennial festival is dressed,
and the guest sees not how he should tire of them in a thousand
years." To the scientific forester this is all waste land, and he
pleads for the "higher culture" being applied to it. With every
desire that the natural resources of our country should be
properly developed, we do hope that he will not be entirely
successful in his efforts, and that a few of the woods and wastes
of Nature's own planting may be left for the recreation of the
simple folk who have not yet taken to appraising the value of
everything by the price it will fetch in the market.</p>

<p>The trees described in this volume are the really wild growths
that have lived a natural life; and though many of the photographs
are from planted trees, they are such as have been
allowed to grow as they would, and show the characteristic
branching of the species.<!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>A few words on the life of a tree may be welcomed here by
those readers who have not made a study of botany. Although
the nurseryman makes use of suckers and cuttings for the
quicker multiplication of certain species, every tree in its
natural habitat produces seeds and is reproduced by them.
The flowering of our forest trees is a phenomenon that does not
as a rule attract attention, but their fruiting or seed-bearing
becomes patent to all who visit the woods in autumn. A tree
has lived many years before it is capable of producing seed.
The seed-bearing age is different in each species; thus the
Oak begins to bear when it is between sixty and seventy years
old, the Ash between forty and fifty, the Birch and Sweet Chestnut
at twenty-five years. Some produce seed every year after
that period is reached, others every second, third, or fifth year;
others, again, bear fitfully except at intervals of from six to nine
years, when they produce an enormous crop. Most tree-seeds
germinate in the spring following their maturity, but they are
not all distributed when ripe. The Birch, the Elm, and the
Aspen, for examples, retain their seeds until spring, and these
germinate soon after they have been dispersed.</p>

<p>The seeds contain sufficient nutriment to feed the seedling
whilst it is developing it roots and first real leaves. We can, of
course, go further back in starting our observations of the life
progress of the monarch of the forest. We can dissect the
insignificant greenish flower of the Oak when the future seed
(acorn) is but a single cell, a tiny bag filled with protoplasm.
From that early stage to the period when the tree is first ripe
for conversion into timber we span a century and a half, equal
to two good human lives, and the Oak is but at the point where
a man attains his majority. The Oak is built up after the
fashion by which man attains to his full stature. It is a process
of multiplication of weak, minute cells, which become specialized
for distinct offices in the economy of the vegetable community
we call a tree. Some go to renew and enlarge the roots, others<!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to the perfecting of that system of vessels through which the
crude fluids from the roots are carried up to the topmost leaf,
whence, after undergoing chemical transformation in the leaf
laboratory, it is circulated to all parts of the organism to make
possible the production of more cells. Each of these has a
special task, and it becomes invested with cork or wood to
enable it to become part of the bark or the timber; or it
remains soft and develops the green colouring matter, which
enables it, when exposed to sunlight, to manufacture starch from
carbon and water.</p>

<p>This is very similar to what takes place in the human organism,
where the nutriment taken in is used up in the production of
new cells, which are differentiated into muscle-cells, bone-cells,
epidermal-cells, and so forth, building up or renewing muscles or
nerves, bones or arteries; but the mechanism of distribution is
different, the heart-pump doing the work of capillary attraction
and gravitation. The ancients believed in the Dryads, spirits
that were imprisoned in trees, and whose life was coterminous
with that of the tree; and it will be seen that they had stronger
physical justification for their belief than they knew. Shakespeare
relates how Sycorax, the witch-mother of Caliban, imprisoned
Ariel in a tree; and Huxley finely tells us that "The
plant is an animal confined in a wooden case; and Nature,
like Sycorax, holds thousands of 'delicate Ariels' imprisoned in
every oak. She is jealous of letting us know this; and among
the higher and more conspicuous forms of plants reveals it
only by such obscure manifestations as the shrinking of the
Sensitive Plant, the sudden clasp of the Dion&aelig;a, or, still more
slightly, by the phenomena of the cyclosis."</p>

<p>The tree, as we have indicated, gets its food from the air and
the soil. The rootlets have the power of dissolving the mineral
salts in the soil in which they ramify; some authorities believing
that they are materially helped in this respect&mdash;so far as organic
matter is concerned&mdash;by a fungus that invests them with a<!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
mantle of delicate threads. However that may be, the fluid
that is taken up by the roots is not merely water, but water plus
dissolved mineral matter and nitrogen. At the same time as the
roots are thus absorbing liquid nutriment, the leaves, pierced with
thousands of little <i>stomata</i>, or mouths, take in atmospheric air,
which is compounded chiefly of the gases oxygen and carbon.
The leaf-cells containing the green colouring matter (<i>chlorophyll</i>)
seize hold of the carbon and release the oxygen. The
carbon is then combined with the fluid from the roots by the
vital chemistry of the leaves, and is circulated all over the
system for the sustenance of all the organs and tissues.</p>

<p>The flowering of the trees varies so greatly that it can only
be dealt with satisfactorily as each species is described. It may
be stated, however, that all the true forest trees are wind-fertilized,
and therefore have inconspicuous greenish blossoms.
By true forest trees we mean those that alone or slightly mixed
are capable of forming high forest. The smaller trees, such as
Crab, Rowan, Cherry, Blackthorn, Hawthorn, Buckthorn, etc.,
belong more to the open woodland, to the common and the
hedgerow. These, from their habitat, can be seen singly, and
therefore can make use of the conspicuous flowers that are
fertilized by insects.</p>

<h3>The Oak (<i>Quercus robur</i>).</h3>

<p>When good John Evelyn wrote his "Sylva, or a Discourse
of Forest Trees," he was greatly concerned lest our "wooden
walls" should diminish in strength for want of a succession
of stout Oaks in our woodlands, and therefore he put the Oak
in the forefront of his discourse. To-day steel and teak have
largely supplanted oak in the building of our navy, and our
walls of defence are no longer of wood. Yet in spite of these
changes, and the consequent reduction of the Oak's importance,
we must still look upon it as the typical British tree, and,
regardless of its place in botanical classifications, we shall
follow the lead of our master and place it first on our list.</p>

<p>There is no necessity for entering upon a minute description
of the botanical characters of so well known a tree. The
sturdy, massive trunk, firm as a rock; the broad, rounded
outline of its head, caused by the downward sweeping extremities
of the wide-spreading lower limbs; the wavy outline of the
lobed leaves, and the equally distinct egg-and-cup-shaped fruit&mdash;these
are characters that cannot be confused with those<!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of any other tree, and are the most familiar objects in the
landscape in most parts of our islands. To my mind, no
wood is so awe-inspiring as one filled with old oaks, all so
much alike, yet each with a distinct individuality. We regard
with reverence a human centenarian, who may have nothing
beyond his great age to commend him to us; but we think of
the long period of history of which he has been a spectator,
possibly an active maker of history. The huge Oak has
probably lived through ten or twenty such periods. Compared
with the Oak, man is but of mushroom growth. It does not
produce an acorn until sixty or seventy years old, and even
then it is not mature. Not till a century and a half have
passed over its head is its timber fit for use, and as a rule
it is not felled under the age of two hundred years. Many
trees are left to a much greater age, or we should not have
still with us so many venerable specimens, and where they
have not been left until partially decayed, the timber is found
to be still very valuable when finally cut down. Of one of
these patriarchs of the forest, cut down in the year 1810,
we have figures of quantity and value from a contemporary
record. It was known as the Gelenos Oak, and stood
about four miles from Newport, Monmouthshire. When felled,
it yielded 2426 cubic feet of sound timber, and six tons of bark.
It was bought just as it stood for £405, and the purchaser
had to pay £82 for labour for stripping, felling, and converting
into timber. Five men were employed for twenty days in
stripping the bark and felling the tree, and after that a pair
of sawyers, working six days a week, were five months
cutting it up. But the bark realized £200, and the timber
about £400. The timber and bark from this one tree were
about equal to the average produce of three acres of oak
coppice after fifteen years growth.</p>

<p>Full-grown oaks vary in height from sixty to one hundred
and thirty feet, the difference depending upon situation; the<!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
tallest, of course, being those that have been drawn up in
forests, at the expense of their branches. Trees growing
freely in the open are of less height, and are made to appear
comparative dwarfs by the huge proportions of the bole. In
the forest this may be no more than ten feet in girth, but in
isolated specimens may be as much as fifty-four feet (Cowthorpe
Oak), with a much broader base. The thick rough bark is
deeply furrowed in a large network pattern, which affords
temporary hiding-places for insects. The branches are much
given to turn and zig-zag from side to side&mdash;a character that<!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
makes them very useful in boat-building, as "knees" of
various angles may be cut from them without having recourse
to bending. The best knees are to be obtained from Oaks
grown in the hedgerow.</p>

<span class="caption">Oak.
<br />
A, female flower; B, male flowers.</span>
</div>

<p>The Oak flowers in April or May, and the blossoms are of
two distinct forms&mdash;male and female. The males are in little
clusters, which are borne at intervals along a hanging stalk,
two or three inches in length. They are green, and therefore
inconspicuous; but examined separately, they will be found to
have a definite calyx, whose margin is cut into an uncertain
number (4-7) of lobes. There are no petals, but attached to
the sides of the calyx there are ten stamens. The female
flowers are fewer, and will be found on short erect stalks
above the male catkins. Each female flower consists of a
calyx, invested by a number of overlapping scales, and enclosing
an ovary with three styles. The ovary is divided
into three cells, each containing two seed-eggs. An acorn
should therefore contain six kernels, but, as a rule, only one
of the seed-eggs develops, though occasionally an acorn
contains two kernels. The overlapping scales at the base
of the female flower become the rough cup that holds the
acorn.</p>

<p>The Oak is subject to a considerable amount of variation,
probably due to differences of situation, soil, etc., and some
authors have sought to elevate certain of the varieties into
species by giving them distinctive names. It does not appear
to be certain, however, that these forms are at all constant,
and they are connected by intermediate forms that make the
identification of many individuals a matter of difficulty. In
one of these forms (<i>sessiliflora</i>) the stalk of the acorns connecting
them with the branch is very short, but the leaves
have a distinct footstalk, from half an inch to an inch long.
This form is more plentiful in the north and west, and is
conspicuous in the Forest of Dean. A second form, known<!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
as <i>pedunculata</i>, has the leaf-stalk short or absent, the base
of the leaf broad and somewhat heart-shaped, and the stalk
upon which the acorns are borne very long. A third form
(<i>intermedia</i>), commonly known as Durmast, has short leaf-stalks,
short stalks to the acorns, and the under side of the
leaf downy. <i>Pedunculata</i> is found more on the lower hills
and the sides of valleys, whilst <i>sessiliflora</i> prefers higher ground,
with a southern or western aspect.</p>

Flowers of Oak.</span>
</div>

<p>The Oak is most abundant on clay soils, but is at its best
when growing in deep sandy loam, where there is also plenty
of humus. Its roots in such soil strike down to a depth of
five feet, and therefore it thrives in association with Beech,
whose roots are much nearer the surface, and whose fallen
leaves supply it with humus.</p>

<p>The Oak is more persistently attacked by insects than any
other tree. One authority (Leunis) has tabulated the species
that get their living mainly or entirely from their attacks on
the foliage, timber, or bark, and they number about five
hundred. With some species this warfare is waged on so
extensive a scale, that in some years by early summer the
Oaks are almost divested of their foliage, and a new crop of
leaves becomes a necessity. But the reserve forces of the
Oak are quite equal to this drain, and the tree does not
appear to suffer, though a much less thorough attack would
be serious to a Conifer. One of the worst of these Oak-spoilers&mdash;though
it by no means restricts its energies to attacks on
this tree&mdash;is the Mottled Umber Moth (<i>Hibernia defoliaria</i>),
whose pretty caterpillars may be seen hanging by silken
threads from the leafless twigs.</p>

<p>A striking Oak insect is the Stag Beetle (<i>Lucanus cervus</i>),
which, in warm evenings in the south of England, may be
seen flying round the Oaks, the size and antler-like jaws of
the male arousing feelings of respect in the minds of those
who are not acquainted with its habits. The formidable<!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
looking "horns" are usually harmless. The beetle spends its
larval stage in the wood of unhealthy Oaks, and, when
mature, seeks his hornless mate among its foliage.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting of the Oak's pensioners to the
woodland rambler will be the varied forms of gall on different
parts of the tree. There is the so-called Oak-apple, of uneven
surface and spongy to the touch, which certain people still
wear on May 29th, in honour of Charles II.; the well-rounded
hard Bullet-gall of <i>Cynips kollari</i>, the Artichoke-gall of
<i>Cynips gemm&aelig;</i>, the Spangle-galls of <i>Neuroterus lenticularis</i>,
so plentiful on the back of the leaf, and the Root-gall of
<i>Biorhiza aptera</i>. All these galls are abnormal growths, due
to the irritation set up by the Gall-wasps named, when they
pierced the young tissues in order to lay their eggs in them.
Where any of these galls are perforated it may be known
that the Gall-wasp whose grub fed within has flown, but
where there is no such perforation the grub is still within,
feeding upon the flesh of the gall, or in the chrysalis stage,
awaiting translation to the winged condition.</p>

<p>Several Oaks of foreign origin are also grown in our parks
and open spaces; among them the Holm Oak (<i>Quercus ilex</i>)
whose evergreen leathery leaves have toothed or plain edges,
and occasionally the lower ones develop marginal spines,
whence its name of Holm or Holly Oak. It is notable for
retaining its lower branches, so that its appearance, as Loudon
remarks, "even when fully grown, is that of an immense bush,
rather than that of a timber tree." It is a native of Southern
Europe and North Africa, and appears to have been introduced
about the middle of the sixteenth century. It usually attains
a height of from twenty to thirty feet, but occasionally
specimens are seen up to sixty feet. It has a much thinner,
more even bark than that of our native Oak, and of a black
colour. The long brown acorns do not ripen until the second
year.</p>

Acorns of Turkey Oak.</span>
</div>
<p><!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>The Turkey Oak (<i>Quercus cerris</i>) is a much larger tree,
attaining to similar heights to our British Oak, but easily
distinguishable by its more pyramidal outline, and its attenuated
leaves. The lance-shaped lobes of these are unequal,
sharp, and angular; and the footless acorn-cups are covered
with bristly or mossy-looking scales. The acorns, which are
small and exceedingly bitter, rarely ripen till their second
autumn. The whole tree&mdash;trunk, branches, and twigs&mdash;is of
straighter growth than <i>Quercus robur</i>. It is a native of
Southern Europe and the Levant, and was introduced about
one hundred and seventy years ago.</p>

<p>The spring rambler in the woods may come upon a party
of woodmen stripping young Oaks of their bark, or felling
them, whilst cylinders of separated bark rest across poles in the
process of drying. This is the industry of barking for the
purpose of the tanner. When the Oaks in a coppice are
about sixteen years old they are most suitable for this purpose,
the bark then containing a larger percentage of <i>tannin</i> than
at any other period. The operation is best performed in May,
when the sap is in flow, and should be completed between the
first swelling of the leaf-buds and the unrolling of the leaves.
If the weather is cold and damp the bark will peel the better,
provided there is an absence of north or east winds. Before
the tree is cut down the bole is stripped, the first ring being
taken from just above the roots to a height of two and a half
feet above. When the tree is felled, it is cut into lengths and
the bark stripped from them; then all branches that are an inch
or more in diameter are peeled. The bark is piled to dry for a
couple of weeks, and is then broken into small pieces and sent
away in sacks.</p>

<p>It is not alone in the use of the bark that the tannic acid of
the Oak is made evident; it is to the presence of this that the
austerity of the acorn is due, and also the ink-producing
properties of certain Oak-galls. Everything connected with<!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the tree gets a roughness of flavour from this same principle.
Even that remarkable fungus, the Vegetable Beef-steak, that
may be found on old Oaks in autumn, is impregnated with it.</p>

<p>Prior regards the name Oak (Anglo-Saxon <i>ac</i>) as originally
belonging to the fruit, and only later transferred to the tree
that produces it. The more obvious explanation (though we
know that in etymological and other matters the obvious is
not always the true interpretation) is, that acorn (ac-corn)
signified the corn or fruit of the ac. Selby tells us that
"During the Anglo-Saxon rule, and even for some time after
the Conquest, Oak-forests were chiefly valued for the fattening
of swine. Laws relating to pannage, or the fattening of hogs in
the forest, were enacted during the Heptarchy; and by Ina's
statutes, any person wantonly injuring or destroying an Oak-tree
was mulcted in a fine varying according to size, or the
quantity of mast it produced."</p>

<h3>The Beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>).</h3>

<p>We speak of the Oak as the "Monarch of the Woods," and
to the Beech the title "Mother of Forests" has been given.
To the timber-merchant the Beech has little importance, but
the grower of timber freely acknowledges his heavy indebtedness
to this nursing mother, for, in the words of Professor
Gayer, the Bavarian forestry expert, "without Beech there can
no more be properly tended forests of broad-leaved genera, as
along with it would have to be given up many other valuable
timber-trees, whose production is only possible with the aid of
Beech." Quite apart from utilitarian considerations, we should
be very sorry to lose the Beech, with its towering, massive shaft
clad in smooth grey bark, its spreading roots above the soil,
and the dense shade of its fine foliage. Fortunately for the lover
of natural beauty, it is this luxuriant growth of leaves and the
shade it gives that are the redeeming virtues of the Beech<!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
in the eye of the forester. Its drip destroys most of the soil-exhausting
weeds, its shade protects the soil from over-evaporation,
and the heavy crop of leaves enriches it by their
decomposition. On these points the forestry experts of to-day
join hands with John Evelyn, who, nearly 250 years ago, thus
referred to it&mdash;"The shade unpropitious to corn and grass,
but sweet, and of all the rest, most refreshing to the weary
shepherd&mdash;<i>lentus in umbra</i>, echoing Amaryllis with his oaten
pipe." And, again, after giving us a long catalogue of the
varied uses to which Beechwood may be put, he adds&mdash;"Yet
for all this, you would not wonder to hear me deplore the so
frequent use of this wood, if you did consider that the industry
of France furnishes that country for all domestic utensils with
excellent Walnut, a material infinitely preferable to the best
Beech, which is indeed good only for shade and for the fire."
In the days of open hearths and chimney corners the Beech
was extensively used for fuel, and it is still reputed to make
good charcoal; but to-day the chairmaker and the turner are
the chief users of its wood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="PLATE_11" id="PLATE_11"></a>
<a href="images/i_034.jpg"><img src="images/i_034_tn.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><i>Pl. 11.</i>
<br />
Bole of Beech.</span>
</div>

<p>The Beech well grown attains a height of about 100 feet,
and a girth of 20 feet. There was, until recently, a Beech
in Norbury Park, Surrey, 160 feet in height. Its branches
horizontally spreading gave it a head of enormous proportions.
Hooker gives the <i>diameter</i> of the Knowle Beech as 352 feet,
which means a circumference of about as many yards. It
will grow in most upland places where the Oak thrives, though
it does not need so deep a soil, and has a preference for land
containing lime. Fresh mineral soils, rich in humus, are the
best for it. In poor soils its growth is slow and its life is longer.
It begins to bear mostly at about eighteen years of age, and
thereafter gives good crops at intervals of three or five years.</p>

<p>In spring, just before the buds expand, the twigs of the
Beech have a very distinct appearance. They are long and
slender, placed alternately along the twig, and the brown<!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
envelopes retain their shape long after they have been cast off.
It is interesting to note how well these are mimicked by a glossy
spindle-shaped snail (<i>Clausilia laminata</i>) that has a decided
fondness for the Beech. As the snails crawl up the bole or over
the moss at its base, it is not easy at a glance to say which are
snails and which bud-envelopes. This is one of the protective
resemblances adopted by many animals to give them a chance
of eluding their natural enemies&mdash;in this case the thrush and
other birds.</p>

<p>In the bud the leaf is folded fan-wise, and the folds run
parallel with the nerves. They expand into an oval, smooth-faced
leaf, with slightly scooped edges, and a most delicate fringe
of short gossamer, which falls off later. These leaves Evelyn
recommended as a stuffing for beds, declaring that if "gathered
about the fall, and somewhat before they are much frost-bitten,
[they] afford the best and easiest mattresses in the world to lay
under our quilts instead of straw.... In Switzerland I have
sometimes lain on them to my great refreshment." That last
clause seems to imply that the authorities at home would not
allow the introduction of new-fangled bed-stuffings, but remained
true to straw. These leaves are rich in potash, and as they
readily decay, they produce an admirable humus. In sheltered
places the leaves, turned to a light ruddy-brown colour, are
retained on the lower branches until cast off by the expansion
of the new buds.</p>

<p>In early summer, whilst the leaves are still pellucid, the shade
of a big Beech is particularly inviting. Later the leaves become
opaque, and their glossy surfaces throw back the heat rays.
Then the play of light upon the great mass of foliage is very
fine; but when autumn has turned their deep green to orange
and warm ruddy brown, and they catch the red rays of the
westering sun, the tree appears to be turned into a blazing fire.</p>

<br />
A, female; B, male flowers.</span>
</div>

<p>The Beech flowers in April or May. The blossoms are rather
more conspicuous than is the case with the Oak, for the male<!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
flowers are gathered together in a hanging purplish-brown
rounded tassel with yellow anthers. The female flowers, to the
number of two, three, or four, are clustered in a "cupule" of
overlapping scales, like those of the Oak. But in the Beech the
"cupule" becomes a bristly closed box, which afterwards opens
by one end splitting into four triangular silk-hair-lined valves,
which turn back and reveal the three-sided, sharp-edged "mast."
This mast was formerly a very valuable product of the Beech-woods,
when herds of swine were turned in them to feed upon
the fallen Beech-nuts. Agricultural methods have changed;<!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
but though our hogs are now confined in styes, and fed on a
diet that more rapidly fattens, Beech-mast is still a good food
eagerly taken by such woodland denizens as badgers, deer,
squirrels, and dormice.</p>

<p>The vitality of the Beech is so high that quite frequently the
bole divides at its upper part into several trunks, which rise
straight up, and each attains the dimensions of a complete tree.
Often such a tree stands on a sandy bank, and seems in imminent
danger of toppling over, but its uprightness secures it against
strain, and the roots that it sent down the steep side of the bank
have thickened into strong props. Many such trees may be
found along the hollow lanes in the Greensand district of Surrey,
and we have more than once sheltered from a storm under their
roots.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the value of the Beech as a nurse
for other trees, and its frequent use for that purpose, but it
should also be stated that it is a powerful competitor with other
trees, and if these are left to fight their own battles unaided, the
Beech will be the conqueror. Evelyn saw this more than two
centuries ago, and pointed out that where mixed woods of Oak
and Beech were left to themselves, they ultimately became pure
Beech woods. The Beech appears to gain this advantage
through rooting in the surface soil, and, exhausting it of food
elements, suffers none to penetrate to the lower strata, where
the Oak has its roots.</p>

<p>A number of insects feed upon the Beech, but they are mostly
more beautiful or more singular than destructive. The Copper
Beech, which is so effectively used for ornament in parks, is
merely a sub-variety of the Common Beech, and all the examples
in cultivation are believed to be "sports" from the purple
variety, which itself was a natural sport discovered in a German
wood little more than a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>The modern word Beech is derived from the Anglo-Saxon
<i>boc</i>, <i>bece</i>, <i>beoce</i>, which had very similar equivalents in all branches<!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of the German and Scandinavian family, and from the fact that
the literature of these people was inscribed on tablets of Beech,
our word <i>book</i> has the same origin.</p>

<h3><b>The Birch</b> (<i>Betula alba</i>).</h3>

<p>"The Lady of the Woods," as Coleridge christened the Birch,
is at once the most graceful, the hardiest, and the most ubiquitous
of our forest trees. It grows throughout the length and
breadth of our islands, and seems happy alike on a London
common, in a suburban garden, or far up in the Scottish highlands
(2500 feet). It penetrates farther north than any other
tree, and its presence is a great boon to the natives of Lapland.
It will grow where it is subjected to great heat, as well as where
it must endure extreme cold, with its slender roots exploring
the beds of peat, the rich humus of the old wood, or the raw
soil of the mountain-side, where it has to cling to rocks and a
few mosses. Given plenty of light, and it seems to care for
little else. Though a mere shrub in the far north, with us the
Birch has a trunk sometimes as tall as eighty, but more frequently
fifty feet, and a girth of from two to three feet. In its
first decade it increases in height at the rate of a foot and a
half or two feet in a year; but, of course, there is little breadth
to be built up at the same time. It reaches maturity in half a
century, and before the other half is reached the Birch will have
passed away.</p>

<p>The bark of the Birch is more enduring than its timber,
which may be partly due to its habit of casting off the outer
layer in shreds, like fine tissue-paper, from time to time. The
greater part of the bark is silvery white, which adds to the
apparent slenderness of the tree, and makes it conspicuous from
a long distance; for the attenuated and drooping branches,
dressed in small and loosely hung leaves, sway so constantly<!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
that the trunk is scarcely hidden. The glossy, leathery leaves
vary in shape from a triangular form to a pointed oval, their
edges doubly toothed, and their footstalks long and slender.</p>

<span class="caption">Birch leaves and catkins.</span>
</div>

<p>About April the hanging catkins of the Birch, which were in
evidence in the previous autumn, have matured and become
dark crimson; the scales separate and expose the two stamens
of each flower, which has a single sepal. The female flowers
are in a short, more erect spike, which consists of overlapping
scales (<i>bracts</i>), each containing two or three flowers. The
flowers have neither petals nor sepals, each consisting merely
of an ovary with two slender styles. After fertilization the
female spike has developed into a little oblong cone. The
minute nuts have a pair of delicate wings to each, and as they
are set free from the cones they flutter on the breeze like a
swarm of small flies. The moss that usually covers the ground
beneath the Birch will be found in October to be thickly speckled
with these fruits, which are something more than seeds, as they
are commonly termed; they are really analogous to the acorn&mdash;a
nut within a thin shell. The tree sometimes begins to
produce seed when only fifteen years old; but, as a rule, it is
ten years older before it bears, and thereafter it has a crop
every year.</p>

<p>It is strange how so striking and graceful a tree could have
been so persistently ignored by the old school of landscape
painters, when one remembers with what good effect modern
artists have utilized it. In this connection we need not apologize
for quoting at length a description of the tree from the
artist's point of view, because it also gives attention to those
points one would like the rambler to notice. Mr. P. G. Hamerton
in his <i>Sylvan Year</i>, says&mdash;</p>

<p>"The stem ... of the Silver Birch is one of the masterpieces
of Nature. Everything has been done to heighten its unrivalled
brilliance. The horizontal peeling of the bark, making dark
rings at irregular distances, the brown spots, the dark colour of<!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the small twigs, the rough texture near the ground, and the
exquisite silky smoothness of the tight white bands above, offer
exactly that variety of contrast which makes us feel a rare
quality like that smooth whiteness as strongly as we are capable
of feeling it. And amongst the common effects in all northern
countries, one of the most brilliant is the opposition of birch
trunks in sunshine against the deep blue or purple of a mountain
distance in shadow. At all seasons of the year the beauty of
the birch is attractive and peculiarly its own. The young beech
may remind you of it occasionally under strong effects of light,
and is also very graceful, but we have no tree that rivals the<!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
birch in its own qualities of colour and form, still less in that
air and bearing which are so much more difficult to describe.
In winter you see the full delicacy of the sprays that the lightest
foliage hides, and in early spring this tree clothes itself, next
after the willow, with tiny triangular leaves, inexpressibly light
in the mass, so that from a distance they have the effect of a
green mist rather than anything more material. When the
tree is isolated sufficiently to come against the sky, you may
see one of the prettiest sights in Nature&mdash;the pure deep azure
of heaven, with the silvery white and fresh green of the birch in
opposition. And yet it is not a crude green, for there is a good
deal of warm red in it, which gives one of those precious tertiaries
that all true colourists value."</p>

<p>Linn&aelig;us named our common Birch <i>Betula alba</i>; but more
than a century ago Ehrhart pointed out that there were two
well-defined forms of the tree, which he proposed to separate as
distinct species under the names of <i>B. verrucosa</i> and <i>B. pubescens</i>.
Hooker regards the first of these as the typical form, for
which he properly retains the Linn&aelig;an name. It is distinguished
by having the base of the bole covered with coarse, rough, and
blackish bark, the <i>smooth</i> leaves looking as though their base
had been cut off, and the twigs warty. The <i>B. pubescens</i> of
Ehrhart appears to be a variety of Fries' <i>B. glutinosa</i>, which
Hooker treats as a sub-species of <i>B. alba</i>. The bark at its
base is smooth and white, its <i>downy</i> leaves have a triangular
base, and its twigs are free from warts. It sometimes assumes
a bush-like form.</p>

<p>The Dwarf Birch (<i>Betula nana</i>) is a distinct species, which
occurs locally in the mountainous parts of Northumberland and
Scotland. It is not a tree, but a bush, only two or three feet in
height. Its firm-textured, round leaves have scalloped margins
and short footstalks.</p>

</div>

<p>The foliage of the Birch in autumn turns to a yellow hue. At
this period&mdash;and, indeed, for a month earlier&mdash;there may be<!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
seen beneath the Birch-trees one of the most striking of our
toadstools, the Fly Agaric (<i>Amanita muscarius</i>), so-called from
its use as the lethal ingredient in the making of fly-papers.
From a bulbous base a creamy yellow stem arises, decked about
half its height with an ample hanging frill. The upper side of
the spreading "cap" is painted with crimson, over which are
scattered flecks of white or cream kid&mdash;the remains of an outer
envelope that was ruptured by the expansion of the cap, and of
which the frill represents the lower portion. This species is
really poisonous, and the Kamschatkans are said to make their
<i>vodka</i> superlatively intoxicating by the addition of this fungus
to it. On the trunk of the Birch may sometimes be found
a large fungus named <i>Polyporus betulinus</i>, whose root-like
portion penetrates the bark and sucks up the sap.</p>

<p>Birch-bark is used for tanning certain kinds of leather, and
the peculiar odour of Russian leather is said to be due to the
use of Birch in its preparation. The Birch agrees with the
Beech in two respects&mdash;it is of little value for timber, but as a
nurse to young timber-trees it is of considerable importance.
Its name is from the Anglo-Saxon <i>beorc</i>, <i>birce</i>, and signifies the
Bark-tree.</p>

Alder&mdash;summer.</span>

<h3>The Alder (<i>Alnus glutinosa</i>).</h3>

<p>Although the Alder is abundant by riversides and in all low-lying
moist lands as far north as Caithness, it is not so generally
well known at sight as the Oak, the Beech, and the Birch. It is
a small tree ordinarily only thirty to forty feet in height, with a
girth from three to six feet, though occasionally it aspires to
seventy feet in height. This is when it is growing in moist loam,
upon which rain or floods have washed down good layers of
humus from woods at a higher elevation. If, with its roots thus
well cared for, its head is in a humid atmosphere, the Alder is in
happy case. If it has had the misfortune to get into a porous<!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
soil, though this may be moist enough to please an Ash, the
Alder becomes merely a big bush.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i_050.jpg"><img src="images/i_050_tn.jpg" width="400" height="361" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Alder.</span>
</div>

<p>The bark of the Alder is rough and black, and the wood soft.
Whilst the tree is alive its wood is white, but when cut and
exposed to the air it becomes red; finally, on drying, it changes to
a pinkish tint. As timber it has no great reputation, except for
piles or other submerged purposes, when it is said to be exceedingly
durable. It has also enjoyed a great reputation for
making the best charcoal for the gunpowder mills, and it is
largely used by the turner, the wood-carver, and the cabinet-<!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>maker.
The leaves, which have short stalks, and are from two
to four inches long, are roundish with a wedge-shaped base.
They have a waved and toothed margin, and remain green
long after the leaves of other trees have fallen. In their young
condition these leaves are covered with hairs, and are sticky to
the touch, and it is to this fact that the name <i>glutinosa</i> has
reference.</p>

<p>The flowering of the Alder is very similar to that of the Birch,
but the male catkins have red scales, and each flower four stamens.
The female spikes have the fleshy scales covered by red-brown
bracts of a woody consistence, which persist after the fruit has
dropped out of them. Seed is not produced until the Alder is
twenty years old, and the crop is repeated almost every year
after. The cones are ripe about October or November, when
they scatter their fruit, but the empty ones persist in hanging to
the branches throughout the winter in numbers sufficient to give
the leafless tree a brown appearance from a little distance. The
immature male catkins are in evidence at the same time.</p>

<p>There is a variety (<i>incisa</i>) of the Alder in which the leaves are
so deeply toothed that they bear a close resemblance to those
of the Hawthorn.</p>

<p>In some localities the tree is called the Howler and Aller, the
latter word apparently the original name, for its Anglo-Saxon
forms were <i>&aelig;lr</i>, <i>alr</i>, and <i>aler</i>.</p>

<h3>The Hornbeam (<i>Carpinus betulus</i>).</h3>

<p>The Hornbeam is frequently passed by as a Beech, to which
it has a very close superficial likeness, but a comparison of leaves,
flowers, or bole would at once make the differences obvious. It
is usually found in similar situations to the Beech, though it
does not ascend so far up the hills as that species. On dry, poor
soils it does not attain its full proportions and may only be classed
as a small tree; but when growing on low ground, in rich loam<!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
or good clay, it reaches a height of seventy feet, with a girth of
ten feet. If two measurements of the bole's diameter be taken
at right angles to each other, they will be found to differ greatly.
A section of the trunk will not show a circular outline, but rather
an ellipse, the bole appearing to have been flattened on two sides.
It is coated with a smooth grey bark, usually spotted with white.</p>

<p>The leaves are less symmetrical than those of Beech, and are
broader towards the base. They are of rougher texture, hairy
on the underside, and their edges are doubly toothed. In
autumn they turn yellow, then to ruddy gold, but a few days later
they have settled into the rusty hue they retain throughout
the winter, in those cases where they remain on the tree until
spring.</p>

<p>The wood is exceedingly tough, and not to be worked up with
ease, but it is considered to make admirable fuel. Evelyn says,
"It burns like a candle." There are those who say that the name
Hornbeam has reference to the tough or hornlike character of
its beams; others declare that in the days when bullocks were
yoked to the plough the yoke was made of this wood, as being
fitted by its toughness to stand the strain, and as it was attached
to the horns, it became the horn-beam. A third theory is that
the name was derived from <i>Ornus</i>, the Manna-ash, with which
early botanists confused it, but with all respect to the authority of
Dr. Prior, who favours it, we prefer to stand on the first suggestion,
with old John Gerarde, who says ("Herball," 1633): "In
time it waxeth so hard that the toughnesse and hardnesse of it
may be rather compared to horn than unto wood, and therefore
it was called Hornbeam or hardbeam." The carpenter is not
pleased who has hornbeam to work up, for his tools lose their
edge far too quickly for his labour to be profitable. Evelyn tells
us that it was called by some the Horse-beech, from the resemblance
of the leaves.</p>

<p>The two kinds of catkins are similar and cylindrical, but
whilst the male is pendulous from the beginning, the female is<!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
erect until after the formation of the fruit, when it gradually
assumes the hanging position. The bracts of the male are oval,
with sharp tips, each containing an uncertain (3-12) number of
stamens. In the female the bracts fall early, but their place
is taken by three-lobed bracteoles, which enlarge after flowering,
and become an inch or an inch and a half long. A single flower
occupies each bracteole, consisting of a two-celled ovary and two
styles. Only one cell develops, so that the hard green fruit contains
but one seed. The appearance of these fruits in autumn
as they hang in a spray from the underside of the branches is
quite distinct from those of any other of our native trees.<!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hornbeam's title to be considered indigenous has had
some doubts thrown upon it because there are some records of
specimens having been introduced during the fifteenth century,
but that is not sufficient ground upon which to deny nationality.
We have known persons to bring home from distant parts as
treasures wild plants and ferns that were growing within a mile of
their own homes. It appears to be a real native of the southern
and midland counties of England, and of Wales. A line drawn
across the map from North Wales to Norfolk roughly marks the
limit; north of that line the Hornbeam appears to have been
planted, as also in Ireland.</p>

<h3>The Hazel (<i>Corylus avellana</i>).</h3>

<p>It is rarely that the Hazel is allowed in this country to develop
into a tree; as a rule it is a shrub, forming undergrowth in wood
or copse, or part of a hedge. As it is cut down with the copse
or hedge, it cannot form a standard of any size. But that the
Hazel left alone will develop into a small tree is shown by an
example in Eastwell Park, Kent, whose height a few years ago
was thirty feet, with a circumference of three feet round the bole.
As soon as the nuts are formed the bush is easily identified by
all, so that a description of its character is hardly necessary.
The large, roundish, heart-shaped leaves are arranged alternately
in two rows along the straight downy shoots. Their margins
are doubly toothed, and when in the bud they are plaited, the
folds being parallel to the midrib. Soon after the buds open,
many of the leaves assume a purplish tint for a while; in autumn
they turn brown, and finally pale to yellow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">Hazel.
<br />
A, female flowers; B, male flowers.</span>
</div>

<p>Before the leaves appear the Hazel is rendered conspicuous by
the male catkins, which are familiar to country children under the
name of Lamb's-tails. These may be seen in an undeveloped condition
in the autumn, when the nuts are being sought. A cluster
of two or three hard, little, grey-green cylinders is all that may<!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
then be seen of them; but throughout the winter they lengthen,
their scales loosen, and in February they are a couple of inches
long, pliant, and yellow with the abundant pollen which blows out
of them as they swing. The female flowers are by no means conspicuous,
and have to be looked for. They will be found in the
form of swollen buds on the upper parts of the shoots and branches,
from which issue some fine crimson threads. These are the styles
and stigmas, and on dissection of the budlike head, each pair
of styles will be seen to spring from a two-celled ovary nestling
between the bracts or scales of which the head is composed. It<!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
is only rarely that the seed-egg in each cell develops; as a rule
one shrivels, and the other develops into the sweet "kernel" of
the Hazel-nut. The shell is the ovary that has become woody
and hard; the ragged-edged leathery "shuck" is the enlarged
bracts that surrounded the minute flower.</p>

<p>The Hazel likes a good soil, and will not really flourish without
it, though it will <i>grow</i> almost anywhere, except where the moisture
is stagnant. Its wood is said to be best when grown on a chalky
subsoil. Of course, as timber, the Hazel does not count, but its
tough and pliant rods and staves are valuable for many small
uses, such as the making of hoops for casks, walking-sticks, and&mdash;divining-rods!
The bark is smooth and brown.</p>

<p>The Barcelona nut, imported so largely in winter, is only a
variety of the Hazel; as also the Cob and the Filbert, so largely
cultivated in Kent. The name is the Anglo-Saxon <i>h&aelig;sl</i>, or
<i>h&aelig;sel</i>, and signifies a baton of authority, from the use of its rods
in driving cattle and slaves.</p>

<h3>The Lime (<i>Tilia platyphyllos</i>).</h3>

<p>Those persons who obtain their ideas of trees mainly from
the specimens they can see in suburban roads and gardens are
in danger of getting quite a false impression of the Lime. It is
a long suffering, good-tempered tree, and like human individuals
of similar temperament, is subjected to shameful treatment.
The suburban gardener who has a row of Limes to trim uses
the saw, and amputates every arm close up to the shoulder, so
that when the season of budding and burgeoning arrives the
row of Limes will look like an upward extension in green of the
brick wall. Such are the atrocities upon which Suburbia has
to base its ideas of one of the most imposing of trees.</p>

<p>The Large-leaved Lime, growing in park-land or meadow,
with its roots deep in good light loam, and its head eighty or<!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
ninety feet above, is quite another matter. Such a tree is a
thing of beauty, and one can stand long at its base looking up
among the wide-spreading limbs so well clothed with leaves of
fine texture and tint. The girth of such a specimen at four feet
from the ground would be about fifteen feet. Larger individuals
have been recorded, up to twenty-seven feet.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of Lime in general cultivation in this
country, but the differences between them are not great. They
are the Large-leaved (<i>Tilia platyphyllos</i>), the Small-leaved
(<i>T. parvifolia</i>), and the Intermediate or Common Lime (<i>T.
vulgaris</i>). The last-named is generally admitted to be an
introduced kind, and it is the one most commonly planted.
Respecting the claims of the other two to rank as natives, there
has been some difference of opinion among authorities. The
Small-leaved Lime, which does not occur in woods north of
Cumberland, was regarded by Borrer as a true indigene, but H. C.
Watson considered its claims as open to doubt, though he had
no such doubt of the Large-leaved Lime, which is only growing
really wild in the woods of Herefordshire, Radnorshire, and the
West Riding of Yorkshire.</p>

<span class="caption">Lime.</span>
</div>

<p>All our Limes have similar straight tall stems, clad in smooth
bark, and with a similar habit of growth. They are trees that
demand genial climatic conditions for their proper development,
and in consequence they do not put forth their leaves until May.
The period of their leafy glory is comparatively short, for they
are among the trees that lose their leaves earliest in autumn, after
having been for a few days transmuted into gold. The leaf of
the Lime is heart-shaped, with one of the basal lobes larger
than the other, and the edges cut into saw-like teeth. There
are slight differences in those of the three species, which will be
indicated below.</p>

<p>In its floral arrangements the Lime differs from the trees
previously mentioned in that it has distinct sepals and petals,
an abundance of honey, and strong, sweet fragrance as of<!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Honeysuckle. Unlike them, it does not trust to so rough and
ready an agent of fertilization as the wind, so that it waits until
its boughs are well clothed with leaves before putting forth its
yellowish-white blossoms. These are in clusters (<i>cymes</i>) of six
or seven, the stalks of all arising from one very long and stouter
stalk, which is attached for half its length to a thin and narrow
bract. Individually regarded, the flowers will be found to consist
of five sepals, five petals, an oval ovary with a style ending
in a five-toothed stigma, and surrounded by a large number of
stamens. The stamens discharge their pollen before the stigma
of that flower is fitted to receive it, so that cross-fertilization is
ensured by the visits of the innumerable bees that visit the
flowers for the abundant nectar they contain, and which the
bees convert into a first-rate honey.</p>

<p>The flowers are succeeded by globose little fruits, each about<!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
a quarter of an inch across, yellow, and covered with pale
down. In a good season these will be found to contain one
or two seeds, but too often in this country the summers are too
cool to ripen them. The Lime does not begin to bear until
about its thirty-fifth year. It flowers every year thereafter,
but the question of its seed-crop depends entirely upon the
weather.</p>

<p>For the purposes to which large timber is usually put, the
light white wood of the Lime is not highly esteemed, not being
considered of sufficient durability; yet it serves for many
smaller uses, where its lightness and fine grain are strong
recommendations. It must not be forgotten that the wonderful
carvings of Grinling Gibbons were executed in this wood. It is
largely used by the makers of musical instruments; and, as
every one knows, it is from the inner bark of the Lime that those
useful bast mats, which are imported from Russia in such large
numbers, are made. Probably owing to its lightness, again, the
wood was used in old times for making bucklers. The question
of its value as timber is probably never taken into account when
it is planted in this country, where its ornamental appearance as
an avenue or shade-tree is its great recommendation. It is one
of the long-lived trees, its full life-period being certainly five
centuries. Those in St. James's Park are popularly supposed
to have been planted, at the suggestion of John Evelyn, somewhere
about the year 1660. There is a fine Lime avenue in
Bushey Park, probably planted by Dutch William.</p>

<p>Deer and cattle are fond of the foliage and young shoots
if they can get at them. Numerous insects exhibit a like
partiality; of these the caterpillar of the large and handsome
Lime Hawk-moth (<i>Smerinthus tili&aelig;</i>) is the most
characteristic.</p>

<p>The differences between the three species may be briefly
noted:<!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small-leaved Lime</span> (<i>Tilia parvifolia</i>). Does not attain
the large proportions of the others. Leaves about two inches
across, smooth; on the lower surface the axils of the nerves are
glaucous and downy, with hairy patches between nerves. Fruit
thin-shelled and brittle, downy, and very faintly ribbed. The
upper leaves show a tendency to lobing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large-leaved Lime</span> (<i>Tilia platyphyllos</i>). Bark rougher.
Twigs hairy. Leaves larger (four inches) and rougher, downy
beneath, axils of the nerves woolly. Fruit of more oval shape,
woody and strongly ribbed when ripe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Common Lime</span> (<i>Tilia vulgaris</i>). Intermediate between the
others. Leaves larger than those of <i>T. parvifolia</i>, smaller than
those of <i>T. platyphyllos</i>; downy in axils beneath. Twigs
smooth. Fruit woody, but without ribs.</p>

<p>The name Lime was originally Linde, a form which, with the
addition of <i>n</i>, is in use to-day. Chaucer and other English
writers spell it Line and Lyne, and the transition from this
form to that commonly used to-day has been effected by
changing the <i>n</i> to <i>m</i>. Originally it meant <i>pliant</i>, and had
reference to the useful bast from which cordage and other
flexible things were made.</p>


<h3>The Wych Elm (<i>Ulmus montana</i>).</h3>

<p>Of the two species of Elms commonly grown in these islands
this alone is a native, though the Common or Small-leaved
Elm (<i>Ulmus campestris</i>) was introduced from the Continent by
the Romans, so that it has had time to get itself widely distributed
over our country. Other names for the Wych Elm are
Mountain Elm, Scots Elm, and Witch Hazel&mdash;the last-named
being now more generally applied to an American plant, the
<i>Hamamelis</i>. The philologists appear to be uncertain as to the
origin and meaning of Wych, but it seems most probably a form<!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
of Witch. Just as a Hazel-rod is used by water-finders, who
declare that its movements indicate the presence of hidden
springs, so a wand of <i>Ulmus montana</i> may have furnished
the Witch-finder with a Witch Hazel for the detection of
witches!</p>

Fruits of Wych Elm.</span>
</div>

<p>The names <i>montana</i>, <i>campestris</i>, and Mountain Elm must not
be allowed to mislead us as to the habits of the two species, for
though the Wych Elm is known to reach an altitude of 3300
feet in the Alps, here it ascends only to 1300 feet (Yorks.),
whilst <i>Ulmus campestris</i>, which might be understood to be
less a hill-climber, grows at an elevation of 1500 feet in Derbyshire.
As a matter of fact, both species are much fonder of
valleys than of mountains.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i_078.jpg"><img src="images/i_078_tn.jpg" width="400" height="333" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Wych Elm.</span>
</div>

<p>The Wych Elm forms a trunk of large size, from 80 to
120 feet or more in height, with a girth of 50 feet, and covered
with rough bark that is often corky. Its long slender branches
spread widely with a downward tendency, the downy forking
twigs bearing their leaves in a straight row along each side.
The leaves are somewhat oval in general form, but the two sides
of the midrib are unequal in size and shape. Their edges are
doubly or trebly toothed, and the surfaces are rough and harsh
to the touch. The hairs that cover the strong ribs on the under
surface serve for the protection of the breathing pores from
dust. On leaves of the pendulous form of this tree, grown in the
London parks and gardens, these hairs will be found to be
quite black with the soot particles gathered from the air. Trees
need carbon, but in this gross form they are too often suffocated
by it.</p>

<p>In March or April the brownish flowers are produced in
bunches from the sides of the branches. They are a quarter of
an inch long, bell-shaped, their edges cut into lobes, and finely
fringed. The ovary, with its two awl-shaped styles, is surrounded
by four or five stamens with purple anthers. They
appear in March or April, before the leaf-buds have opened,<!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and are dependent on the wind for the transfer of pollen. The
fruit is an oblong <i>samara</i>, about an inch long. This consists of
a single seed in the centre, invested by a thin envelope, which is
extended all round as a light membranous wing, which gives
it buoyancy and enables it to float through the air to a little
distance. These seeds are not produced until about the
thirtieth year of the tree's life, and though they are ripened
almost annually thereafter, good crops are biennial or triennial
only. It has often been stated that the Wych Elm does not
send up suckers, but it does, though not invariably; it does
so chiefly as the result of root-pruning or some other check to
the extension of the root-system.</p>

<p>The Elm most frequently seen is the Small-leaved Elm<!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
(<i>Ulmus campestris</i>), which is therefore entitled to its alternative
name of Common Elm. Constantly grown as a hedgerow
tree, it meets us at every turn, though it is much less plentiful
in Scotland than in other parts of the United Kingdom.
It is in all respects very similar to the Wych Elm, but
its leaves are smaller&mdash;usually from two to three inches long,
the twigs often covered with a corky bark, and the seed,
instead of being in the centre of the samara, is much nearer
to the notched end. The leaves are proportionately narrower
than those of <i>montana</i>, and it will be found that the hairs which
cover the midrib below possess in minor degree the irritating
qualities of the Nettle's stings. This is a fact not generally
known, but I became painfully aware of it a few years ago when
clearing away the suckers of an Elm that were encroaching too
much upon my garden border. Examination of these hairs
shows that they are constructed much on the same plan as those
of the Nettle&mdash;a member of the same Natural Order, by the
way. The fact that these leaves are browsed by cattle and
deer may explain this development of the hairs, which, whilst
they may serve to keep off sheep, have not yet reached a degree
of acridity sufficient to protect them from the larger beasts. Both
flowers and samaras are about a third smaller than those of
<i>montana</i>; but seed is very seldom produced in this country,
and the tree seeks to reproduce itself by throwing up abundant
suckers round the base of the bole, and even from root-branches
at a considerable distance from the trunk. These, of course, if
allowed to grow, would soon surround the tree with copse.</p>

<p><i>Campestris</i> often attains a greater height with its straighter
trunk than <i>montana</i>, but its girth is not so great, seldom
being more than twenty feet. Its dark wood is harder and
finer grained than that produced by the native tree. Its
favour as a hedgerow tree is probably due to the fact that
it gives shade which is not obnoxious to the growth of grass.<!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Both species are subject to a great amount of variation, and
in nurserymen's catalogues these forms have appropriate
names, but they are not regarded as of sufficient permanence
to merit scientific distinction. In point of age&mdash;Elms are
known to exceed five hundred years.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">Common Elm.</span>
</div>

<p>Among the insects that feed upon the Elm's foliage, the
most noteworthy is the caterpillar of the fine Large Tortoiseshell
Butterfly (<i>Vanessa polychloros</i>). I have already mentioned
the relationship subsisting between Elms and Nettles, and it
is a point worth noting that nearly all our native species of
<i>Vanessa</i> feed in the larval state upon the leaves of the Nettle.
In London parks and squares the Elms are much infested<!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
by the caterpillars of the Vapourer-moth, whose wingless
females may be seen like short-legged spiders on the bark,
whilst the male flutters in an apparently aimless way on wings
of rich brown with central white spots.</p>

<p>In October the leaves, which have for some time assumed
a very dull dark-green tint, suddenly turn to orange, then
fade to pale yellow, and fall in showers.</p>

<p>The name Elm was derived from the Latin <i>Ulmus</i>, and
appears to indicate an instrument of punishment&mdash;probably
from its rods having been used to belabour slaves. Prior
remarks that the word is "nearly identical in all the Germanic
and Scandinavian dialects, but does not find its root in any
of them. It plays through all the vowels ... but stands
isolated as a foreign word which they have adopted."
This "playing through the vowels" may be thus illustrated&mdash;Alm,
&AElig;lm, and Elm (Anglo-Saxon and English); Ilme,
Olm, and Ulme, in various German dialects.</p>

Ash&mdash;summer.</span>
</div>


<h3>The Ash (<i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>).</h3>

<p>So commanding, yet at the same time so light and graceful,
does a well-grown Ash appear, that Gilpin called it the "Venus
of the Woods." This may appear to some to be rather too
close an approach to the "Lady of the Woods" (Birch), but in
our opinion it well expresses the characteristics of the two.
They are both exceedingly graceful, but the beauty of the
Birch is that of the nymph, whilst that of the Ash is the
combined grace and strength of the goddess. I have said
"a well-grown" Ash, a phrase by which the timberman would
understand a tree that had been hemmed in so closely by
other trees that it has had no chance of developing as a tree,
but only as a straight stout stick of wood, from eighty to one
hundred feet long. <i>My</i> well-grown Ash is in a meadow,<!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
where both soil and atmosphere are moist and cool; where
it has had elbow-room to reach its long graceful arms upwards
and outwards, and to cover them with the plumy circlets of
long leaves. It is there, or on the outskirts of the wood, or
in the hedgerow, that the Ash is able to do credit to Gilpin's
name for it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i_088.jpg"><img src="images/i_088_tn.jpg" width="400" height="341" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Ash.</span>
</div>

<p>Before the reign of iron and steel was quite so universal,
Ash timber was in demand for many uses where the metals
have now supplanted it. It was then far more widely grown
as a hedgerow tree than is now the case. Selby laments the
neglect of this former custom, which kept up a supply of<!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
tough and elastic timber, useful in all agricultural operations,
and added much to the beauty of the country. No doubt
the noxious drip and shade of the Ash have had much to
do with this abandonment of it, for few things can live
beneath it&mdash;a condition helped by its numerous fibrous roots,
which quickly exhaust and drain the soil, and so starve out
other plants. Although it thus drains the surface soil, it is
not dependent upon these upper layers for food, for its much-branched
roots extend very deeply in the porous soils it
prefers.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed from the foregoing remarks that
the Ash is confined to the lowlands. In Yorkshire it is found
growing at an elevation of 1350 feet; in Mid-Germany it
grows as far up as 3500 feet, and in the Alpine districts 500
feet higher still. It has a preference for the northern and
eastern sides of hills, where the atmosphere is moist and cool,
and the soil deep and porous, for it loves free and not
stagnant moisture for its roots.</p>

<p>The bark of both trunk and branches is pale grey, and
some look to this as the origin of the tree's English name.
On examining the leafless branches in early spring, two
things strike the observer&mdash;the blackness of the big opposite
leaf-buds, and the stoutness of the twigs. This latter fact is
due to the great size of the leaves they have to support,
which implies a considerable strain in wind or rain. What
are generally regarded as the leaves of the Ash are only
leaflets, though they are equal in size to the leaves of most
of our trees. The largest of the leaflets are about three
inches in length, and there are from four to seven&mdash;mostly
six&mdash;pairs, and an odd terminal one, to each leaf. They
are lance-shaped, with toothed edges. The leaves are late
in appearing, but, like Charles Lamb and his office-hours, they
make up for it by an early departure.</p>

Flowers of Ash.</span>
</div>

<p>The flowers of the Ash are very poor affairs, for they have<!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
neither calyx nor corolla, though their association in large
clusters makes them fairly conspicuous as they droop from
the sides of the branches in April or May. Stamens and
pistils are borne by the same or separate flowers, and both
kinds or one only may be found on the same tree. The
pistil is a greenish yellow pear-shaped body, and the stamens
are very dark purple. The flowers are succeeded by bunches
of "keys"&mdash;each one, when ripe, a narrow-oblong scale, with
a notch at one end and a seed lying within at the other.
The correct name for these is samaras. In looking at a
bunch of these "keys"&mdash;they are something like the keys to
the primitive locks of the ancients&mdash;one is struck by the
fact that they all have a little twist in the wing or sail,
which causes the "key" to spin steadily on the wind and
reach the earth seed-end first. They are, therefore, sometimes
known as "spinners." These are ripe in October; but though
the trees produce seed nearly every year after the fortieth,
one may chance to look at a dozen Ashes before he comes
upon one that bears a seed. The reason for this lies in the
fact that some trees have no female blossoms. The seeds
do not germinate until the second spring after they are sown.</p>

<p>Much of the Ash-wood in use for carriage-poles, oars, axe
and hammer shafts, and similar purposes where only small
diameters are needed, are obtained from Ash-coppice, which
rapidly produces well-developed poles. So strong and elastic
is the Ash timber when taken from young trees, that it is
claimed it will bear a greater strain than any other European
timber of equal thickness. The Ash is not one of the long-lived
trees, its natural span being about two hundred years,
but its wood is regarded as best between the ages of thirty
and sixty years.</p>

<p>Cattle and horses are fond of Ash leaves, which were formerly
much used for fodder, and still are in some districts;
but it is said that to indulge cows in this food is fatal to<!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the production of good butter from their milk. In some
country places there is still extant a "Shrew-Ash"&mdash;a tree
into which a hole has been bored sufficiently large to admit
a living shrew-mouse, which has then been plugged in, to
die of suffocation. A touch of a leaf from this tree was
reputed to cure cramp, but especially that form of it supposed
to be caused by a shrew passing over man or beast. Then
there was the Ash whose bole had been cleft that it might
be a "sovran" remedy for infantile hernia. It is difficult to
account for the origin of these ideas, but they are deep-rooted
and die hard. John Evelyn remarks of this latter superstition:
"I have heard it affirmed, with great confidence and
upon experience, that the rupture, to which many children
are obnoxious, is healed by passing the infant through a wide
cleft in the bole or stem of a growing Ash-tree; it is then
carried a second time round the Ash, and caused to repass
the same aperture as before. The rupture of the child being
bound up, it is supposed to heal as the cleft of the tree
closes and coalesces."</p>

<p>The origin of the name Ash is uncertain, though many
fanciful suggestions have been made in explanation of its
meaning. Its Anglo-Saxon form was &aelig;sc, a word used by
the same people for spear, but that was because their spear-shafts
were made of Ash-wood.</p>

Field Maple.</span>

<h3>The Maple (<i>Acer campestre</i>).</h3>

<p>There are a number of Maples in cultivation, but only
three of them are commonly met with in the open, and of
these one alone is a native. This is the Small-leaved, Common,
or Field Maple (<i>Acer campestre</i>), a small tree that attains a
height of twenty or thirty feet in the tall hedgerow or in
the wood, but is most familiar as a mere bush or as a constituent
of the low field-hedge. It does not grow to any<!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
considerable thickness of bole, so has no importance as timber,
but the turner, the cabinet-maker, and the artist in fancy
pipes and snuff-boxes, are glad to make use of its fine-grained,
pale-brown wood. This is often beautifully veined, especially
the wood from the roots, and as it will take a high polish,
which brings out these markings plainly, it is a very desirable
wood for such purposes. The brown bark gives little clue
to the character of the wood it covers, for in young trees
it is rough and deeply fissured, though with age it becomes
smooth.</p>

<span class="caption">Field Maple.</span>
</div>

<p><!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>The leaves vary greatly in size, those growing on a tree
being much larger than those produced by a bush. They
range from two to four inches in diameter, and are always
in pairs&mdash;springing from the sides of the branch exactly
opposite to each other. The general form of the leaf is
kidney-shaped, but it is cut up into five lobes, which are
more or less toothed. They are downy when young, of a
deep green colour, but too frequently this is disguised by
a thick layer of road-dust. In October they turn to a rich
yellow, and the Maple is then prominent even in a distant
view, for the bright colour of the foliage makes the tree stand
out prominently, in strong contrast with the still deep green
of the Oaks or Firs beyond.</p>

<p>The Maples are among the trees that have complete
flowers, although in this case they happen to be greenish
yellow. They are about a quarter of an inch across, have
narrow sepals and narrower petals, eight stamens, and a
two-lobed flattened ovary, that develops into the pair of
broad-winged "keys," or samaras. These are individually
much like those of the Ash, but unsymmetrical and curved,
half an inch long, with their bases joined together. Sometimes
in late summer these "keys" take on a colouring of deep
crimson, previous to turning brown as they ripen. As a
rule the contained seeds take eighteen months to germinate,
though a few may start growth the first spring.</p>

<p>The Common Maple is thought to be indigenous only from
the county of Durham to the southern coast, and in Ireland.
In Scotland it is only an introduced plant that has become
naturalized.</p>

<p>The Great Maple, Sycamore, or False Plane (<i>Acer pseudo-platanus</i>)
is not a native tree, but it appears to have been
introduced from the Continent as far back as the fifteenth
century, so that it has had time during the intervening centuries
to get well established among us, and by means of its<!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
winged seeds to distribute itself to remote corners of our islands.
It appears to be fond of exposed situations, growing to a large
size even near the sea, where the salt-laden gales destroy all
other deciduous trees. Recently in Ireland we ascended a
hill where the planting of pines and other trees had resulted
in comparative failure, and found that the wind-borne seeds
of the Sycamore had produced a large number of young
trees, which will probably serve later as nurses for more
desirable timber-producers. The close-grained, firm wood,
which can be worked with ease, is not highly esteemed.</p>

<p>Its name of False Plane is due to the Scots calling it the<!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Plane, misled of old by the similarity of the leaves, and the fact
that patches of the fine ash-grey bark flake off, as in the true
Plane, showing other tints. It grows to a height of sixty or
even eighty feet so quickly that it is full-grown when only fifty
or sixty years old, though it is supposed to live from a hundred
and fifty to two hundred and fifty years. Like that of the
Common Maple, the wood of the Sycamore is firm and fine-grained,
which does credit to the efforts of the French-polisher.
The leaves are more heart-shaped, but cut into five lobes, whose
edges are unequally toothed; they are six or eight inches across.
The flowers are similar to those of the Common Maple, but
larger, and in a long hanging raceme, which has a rather fine
appearance. The samaras are scimitar-shaped and red-brown,
about an inch and a half long. These are produced freely after
the tree is about twenty years old. Like many other Maples,
the Sycamore has sap which contains much sugar. Some of
this appears also to exude through the leaves, for they are often
found to be quite sticky to the touch. The black patches so
frequent on Sycamore leaves are the work of a small fungus&mdash;<i>Rhytisma
acerinum</i>.</p>

<p>The Norway Maple (<i>Acer platanoides</i>) is a tree of much more
recent (1683) introduction from the Continent. Its height is
from thirty to sixty feet, and its early growth is very rapid. The
leaves are even larger than those of Sycamore, of similar shape,
but the lobes are only slightly toothed. The clusters of bright
yellow flowers are almost erect; the tree does not produce seed
until it is between forty and fifty years old.</p>

<p>The Maple was the Mapel-treow or Mapulder of the Anglo-Saxons;
it was originally the Celtic <i>mapwl</i>, and the name
indicated those knotty excrescences on the trunk from which the
cabinet-maker got the mottled wood that was so highly prized
in early times for the making of bowls and table-tops, for which
fabulous prices have been paid.</p>

<h3>The Poplars (<i>Populus</i>).</h3>

<p>Almost everybody who has an elementary acquaintance with
trees knows a Poplar at sight, the foliage being so very distinct
from that of other trees. But the distinctions between the
several species are not so immediately obvious. Five kinds
of Poplar are commonly grown in this country, of which only
two are regarded as distinct indigenous species. These are
the White Poplar (<i>Populus alba</i>), and the Aspen (<i>P. tremula</i>).
A third indigenous form, the Grey Poplar (<i>P. canescens</i>), is
thought to be either a sub-species of <i>P. alba</i>, or a hybrid between
that species and <i>P. tremula</i>. Then of common introduced
species we have the Black Poplar (<i>Populus nigra</i>), and the
Lombardy Poplar (<i>P. fastigiata</i>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="PLATE_49" id="PLATE_49"></a>
<a href="images/i_106.jpg"><img src="images/i_106_tn.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><i>Pl. 49.</i>
<br />
White Poplar, with Catkins&mdash;spring.</span>
</div>

<p>The Poplars (<i>Populus</i>) and the Willows (<i>Salix</i>) together
constitute the Natural Order <i>Salicine&aelig;</i>. The two genera
agree broadly in the construction and arrangement of their
flowers in catkins, but whereas the Poplars have broad leaves
and drooping catkins, the Willows, with few exceptions, have
long slender leaves and erect catkins. The sexes are not
only in distinct flowers, but on separate trees&mdash;what botanists
describe by the term <i>di&oelig;cious</i>. The males appear to be far
more numerous than the females. In the popular sense there
are no flowers, for there are neither sepals nor petals, each
set of sexual organs being protected merely by a scale. The
catkins containing these flowers usually appear before the
leaves. As there is nothing to attract insects to the work,
the trees have to rely upon the wind for conveying the pollen
to the female trees. The first three species described below
have from four to twelve stamens; <i>P. nigra</i> and <i>P. fastigiata</i>
have from twelve to twenty stamens. The Poplars share the
love of the Willows for moist places. They are found more
frequently in gardens and hedgerows than in woods. Their<!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
growth is rapid, and their timber, consequently, is of little value,
though its softness and lightness render it suitable for making
boxes, and its whiteness and non-liability to splinter fit it for
use as flooring. An additional point in favour of White Poplar
for the latter purpose is its unreadiness to burn.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">White Poplar, or Abele.
<br />
A, female catkin.</span>
</div>

<p>The White Poplar, or Abele (<i>Populus alba</i>), grows into a
large tree, something between sixty and a hundred feet high,
covered with smooth grey bark. Its branches spread horizontally,
and its broad heart-shaped leaves, which vary from an
inch to three inches long, are hung on long slender foot-stalks.<!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
In most trees the leaf-stalks are flattened from above, but in
the case of the Poplars they are flattened from the sides, so
that when moved by the wind they flutter laterally. These
leaves have a waved margin, a smooth upper surface, and
are snowy white and cottony beneath. The leaf-buds are
also invested by cottony filaments. The roots produce numerous
suckers, even at a distance from the trunk, and the leaves
on these sucker-shoots are very large&mdash;two to four inches broad&mdash;of
a more triangular shape, the outline lobed and toothed.
The catkins, which appear in March and April, are cylindrical;
those of the male trees may be as much as four inches long,
each flower containing from six to ten stamens with purple
anthers. The female catkins are not nearly so long, the two
yellow stigmas are slender with slit tips, and the ovaries
develop into slender egg-shaped capsules, each with its fringed
scale. This species is said not to produce flowers in Scotland.
In July, when the seed capsules open, the surrounding vegetation
and ground are thickly strewn with the long white cotton
filaments attached to the seeds. The wood of this tree is softer
and more spongy than that of other Poplars.</p>

<p>The Grey Poplar (<i>Populus canescens</i>), which is thought to be
indigenous only in the south-eastern parts of England, is not
so tall a tree as <i>P. alba</i>, though it sometimes attains to eighty
or ninety feet, with a circumference between ten and twenty-four
feet. Its life extends to about a century, but its wood&mdash;which
does not split when nails are driven through thin
boards of it&mdash;is considered best between fifty and sixty years
of age. The leaves on the branches are shaped like those of
<i>P. alba</i>, but their under sides are either coated with grey
down or are quite smooth; those of the suckers have their
margins cut into angles and teeth. The female flowers mostly
have four wedge-shaped purple stigmas (sometimes two), which
are cleft into four at their extremities.</p>

<span class="caption">Aspen.</span>
</div>

<p>The Aspen or Asp (<i>Populus tremula</i>) does not attain either<!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
to so large a size or so moderate an age as the Abele. Its
height, when full grown, is from forty to eighty feet, and after
fifty or sixty years its heart-wood begins to decay, and its
destruction is then hastened by the attacks of such internal-feeding
insects as the caterpillars of the Goat-moth and the
Wood Leopard-moth. The leaves on the branches are broadly
egg-shaped, approaching to round, the waved margin cut
into teeth with turned-in points. In one form (var. <i>villosa</i>)
the leaves are covered beneath with silky or cottony hairs;
in the other form (var. <i>glabra</i>) they are almost smooth.
The leaves on the suckers are heart-shaped, without teeth.<!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
The leaf-stalks of the Aspen are longer than those of its
congeners, so that they are constantly on the flutter&mdash;a circumstance
that has led to an explanatory legend, to the
effect that the cross of Calvary was made of Aspen-wood, and
that the tree shivers perpetually in remembrance. Possibly
the present inferiority of Aspen timber is to be explained in a
similar manner. The catkins, which are two or three inches
long, are similar to those of the foregoing species, but the
scales have jagged edges. It is indigenous in all the British
Islands as far north as Orkney, but, though commonly found
in copses on a moist light soil, is more frequent as a planted
tree in gardens and pleasure grounds. It is a characteristic
tree of the plains throughout the Continent, but ascends to
1600 feet in Yorkshire, and in the Bavarian Alps is found
as high as 4400 feet. It is not a deep-rooting tree, the root-branches
running almost horizontally. Where accessible to
cattle or deer, the foliage of the suckers is eagerly browsed by
them.</p>

<span class="caption">Black Poplar.</span>
</div>

<p>The Black Poplar (<i>Populus nigra</i>) appears to be so called
not by reason of any blackness of leaf or bark, but because of
the absence of any white or grey down on the underside of
its leaves. Its bark is grey, like that of the species already
mentioned, but readily distinguished from them by the great
swellings and nodosities that mar the symmetry of its trunk.
It is a tree of erect growth, fifty to sixty feet in height, with
horizontal branches, and leaves that vary in shape from
triangular and rhombic to almost circular, and in width from
an inch to four inches. They have rounded teeth on the
margins, which are at first also fringed, and in their young
state the underside is silky. The flowers in the catkins of
this and the next species are not so densely packed. Those of
the male are two or three inches in length, and dark red in
colour; their abundance before the tree has put out its leaves
makes the male tree a conspicuous object. The female catkins<!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
are shorter and do not droop. When the roundish capsules
burst in May or June to distribute their seeds, the white cotton
with which the latter are invested gives prominence to the
female tree. The wood is chiefly used by the turner; in
Holland, where it is extensively cultivated, it provides the
material for sabots. The Black Poplar is not a native of this
country, but it is generally distributed throughout Europe and
Northern Asia. The date of its introduction is not known, but
it has been here for many centuries, and is quite naturalized,
springing up on river banks and in other moist situations.
Some botanists regard it as only a variety of the Lombardy
Poplar, but apart from the very different habit of the tree&mdash;not<!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
by itself sufficient grounds for separation&mdash;there is the more
important fact that the Black Poplar rarely produces suckers
from its roots, whilst the Lombardy Poplar does so constantly.
However, this is a point we can leave for the botanists to
discuss; for the purposes of this book the two trees are
sufficiently distinct to be treated separately.</p>

<p>The Lombardy Poplar (<i>Populus fastigiata</i>) is no more a
native of Italy than of England. Its home is in the Taurus and
the Himalayas, whence it has spread into Persia. Introduced
into Southern Europe, it has become specially abundant along the
rivers of Lombardy, and so in France and England it bears the
name of that country. Lord Rochford introduced it to England
from Turin in 1758. Its leaves are like those of the Black Poplar,
but its branches, instead of spreading, all grow straight upwards,
so that the fastigiate or spire shape of the tree is produced&mdash;a
shape only found otherwise among coniferous trees, particularly
in the Cypress, the Juniper and the Irish Yew. It is its form,
great height (100 to 150 feet), and rapidity of growth that have
led to its wide use here as an ornamental tree&mdash;in many cases
as a mere vegetable hoarding to shut out some offensive view.
Its growth is extremely rapid, especially during its first score of
years, when it will attain a height of sixty feet or more, provided
it be grown in good, moist (but not marshy) soil. Its wood is,
of course, of little value, and is chiefly used for making boxes and
packing-cases, where its lightness, combined with toughness and
cheapness, is an advantage. The bark is rough and deeply
furrowed, unlike the other species, and the trunk is twisted.
Like the Black Poplar, it has smooth shoots, and the unopened
buds are sticky. It is propagated in this country by suckers and
cuttings. It is said that the first trees introduced were so
obtained, and that they were all from male trees; consequently,
that we have no female trees here, and seed production is impossible.
If the female grows here, it is certainly very scarce.
The bark has been used for tanning.</p>

<p>The Black Italian Poplar (<i>Populus monilifera</i>) is another misnamed
tree, for it is a native of North America, though introduced
to England from the Continent in 1772 by Dr. John Hope. It
has the distinction of being considered the most rapid-growing
even of the Poplars. Loudon gives its rate of growth in the
neighbourhood of London as between thirty and forty feet in seven
years! Even in Scotland (where it has been largely planted as
a substitute for Larch, since the partial failure of that tree) it
attains a height of 120 feet in sixty years, when planted along
the river banks. It is probably only a variety of <i>P. nigra</i>,
which it resembles in most points, but is larger, and of very
erect growth.</p>

<p>The Tacamahac or Balsam Poplar (<i>Populus balsamifera</i>) is
another importation from North America, introduced in 1692.
In its native country it grows to a height of eighty feet, but here
forty or fifty feet is more usual. Its leaves are of more slender
form than those of the other Poplars, egg-shaped, with a near
approach to being lance-shaped. Their edges are toothed, their
upper surface dark green and smooth, the underside whitish with
cotton. The distinctive character of the tree is the fragrance
of its foliage, which scents the air on moist evenings, and makes
the Tacamahac a desirable tree to plant near the water, where
alone it attains any moderate size.</p>


<h3>The Willows (<i>Salix</i>).</h3>

<p>There is not in the whole of the British flora another genus of
plants that presents such difficulties of identification as the genus
<i>Salix</i>. Even so hardened a botanist as Sir J. D. Hooker, in
reviewing the tangle of species, varieties (natural and cultivated),
and hybrids, is so far stirred from his ordinary composure that
he stigmatizes it as a "troublesome genus." When Sir Joseph
chose that mild adjective he was at Kew surrounded by the
national herbaria and with nicely labelled living plants at hand<!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
for comparison. What, then, can the rambling nature-lover hope
to do with the Willows he comes across one at a time, without
much chance of comparing? He must be content to follow the
"lumpers," who group a number of these uncertain forms under
the name of a species to which they have evident relationship.
When he has mastered the distinctions between these aggregate
species, it will be early enough to attempt the segregation of the
forms and varieties under each.</p>

<p>In their natural condition Willows are graceful and picturesque,
but a large number of the examples met with in our rambles
have been so altered for commercial reasons as to be more
grotesque than beautiful. It is not the timber-man who is
responsible this time, for a pollard Willow, though it produces a
shock-head of long slender shoots, suitable for basket-rods, lets
in moisture at the top of the bole, and the wood is more or less
decayed and worthless. Only four of our native Willows can be
regarded as timber trees. These are the White Willow, the
Crack Willow, the Bedford Willow, and the Sallow. Like the
Poplars, their growth is very rapid, and their wood is consequently
light, but it has the advantage of Poplar-wood in being
tougher, and therefore serving for purposes where Poplar is of no
value. In the present day the growers of straight-boled Willows
find their best market among the makers of cricket-bats. A good
deal of it is also cut into thin strips for plaiting into chip-hats
and hand-baskets. The Osier is grown in extensive riverside
beds for the production of long pliant shoots for the basket-weavers;
though many of the so-called Osier-rods are really
stool-shoots from Willows that have been pollarded, or whose
leading shoot has never been allowed to grow. On those parts
of our coast where the crab and lobster fishery is pursued, a
regular supply of such shoots for weaving into "pots" and
"hullies" is a necessity, and a "withy bed" will usually be found
on some valley stream near, or on a damp terrace halfway up
the cliffs.</p>

<p>The bark of the tree Willows has long been known to be rich
in an alkaloid called <i>salicine</i>, which has tonic and astringent
properties, and has often been used instead of <i>quinine</i>, though it is
not nearly so powerful as the Peruvian drug. The bark is also
used for tanning.</p>

<p>The association of the Willow with sadness is very old, but
there does not appear to be any satisfactory reason for it&mdash;certainly
to contemplate a naturally-grown Willow that grows
on the edge of a limpid stream, in which its graceful shoots and
slender leaves are reflected, does not suggest sad thoughts to the
average healthy mind. The association is chiefly with maidens
forsaken by their false lovers, as indicated by Shakespeare when
he makes Desdemona say&mdash;</p>

<span class="caption">Crack Willow.</span>
</div>

<p>The Crack Willow or Withy (<i>Salix fragilis</i>) is one of the two
most considerable of our tree Willows. In good soil it will in
twenty years attain nearly its full height, which is eighty or ninety
feet. Its bole sometimes has a girth of twenty feet. Its smooth,
polished shoots afford the best ready means of distinguishing it, for
instead of their base pointing to the centre of the trunk as in other
trees, they grow obliquely, so that the shoots frequently cross each
other. They are both tough and pliant, but if struck at the base
they readily break off. This character explains the names Crack
Willow and <i>fragilis</i>. The leaves are lance-shaped, three to six
inches long, smooth, with glandular teeth, pale or glaucous on
the underside, and with half-heart-shaped stipules, which, however,
are soon cast off. As we have already indicated under the
head of Poplars, the male and female catkins of the Willows are
borne by different trees. In the case of the Crack Willow, the
male catkins are an inch or two long, proportionately stout, each<!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
flower bearing two stamens (occasionally three, four, or five).
The female catkin is more slender, the flowers each containing a
smooth ovary, ending in a short style that divides into two curved
stigmas. The catkins appear in April or May. Although, like
most of the Willows, this species is fond of cold, wet soil in low
situations, it is not restricted to the plains. In Northumberland
it is found at 1300 feet above the sea. Its northward range
extends as far as Ross-shire, but it is a doubtful native in both
Scotland and Ireland.</p>

<p>The Bedford Willow (<i>S. russelliana</i>) is believed to be a hybrid
between <i>S. fragilis</i> and <i>S. alba</i>. It grows to a height of fifty
feet, with a girth of twelve feet. The leaves are more slender<!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
than those of <i>S. fragilis</i>, taper to a point at each end, and are
very smooth on both sides. It occurs in swampy woods.</p>

<span class="caption">White Willow.</span>
</div>

<p>The White Willow (<i>Salix alba</i>) is so called from the appearance
of the leaves as the light is reflected from their silky surfaces,
which are alike above and below. It is a tree from sixty to
eighty feet high, with a girth of twenty feet, covered with thick
and deeply fissured bark. The leaves are from two to four inches
long, of a narrow elliptical shape. In the typical form the twigs
are olive-coloured, but in the variety <i>vitellina</i> (known as the
Golden Willow) these are yellow or reddish. In the variety
<i>c&aelig;rulea</i> the old leaves become quite smooth above, but retain
<!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>the glaucous appearance of the underside. The White Willow
is found as far north as Sutherlandshire, but although it is
believed to be an indigenous species, most of the modern specimens
appear to have been planted. It affords good timber, and
the bark is almost equal to that of Oak for tanning. A great
number of the old Willows met with in our rambles are partially
decayed, a condition frequently the result of lopping large
branches, for the wound never heals, and decay setting in at that
point, extends down the bole. Upon such decaying specimens
one may often find one of the most handsome of our native
beetles&mdash;the Musk-beetle, with long, slender body and long
antenn&aelig;, all coloured in dark golden green, and diffusing the
aroma of a rose.</p>

Almond-leaved Willow&mdash;winter.</span>
</div>

<p>The Almond-leaved or French Willow (<i>Salix triandra</i>) is a
small tree about twenty feet high, distinguished by its bark
being thrown off in flakes. Its slender lance-shaped leaves are
smooth green above and glaucous beneath, two to four inches
long, and with half-heart-shaped stipules. The male flowers
offer another distinguishing mark in their stamens being three in
number. Its habitats are the banks of rivers and streams, and
in Osier-beds. It is extensively grown on account of the long,
straight shoots produced from the stump when the tree is cut
down, which are of great use in wicker-work.</p>

<p>The Bay-leaved Willow (<i>Salix pentandra</i>) is met with either
as a small upright tree about twenty feet high, or as a shrub
eight feet high. Its oval or elliptical leaves are rich green,
smooth and sticky on the upper surface, and give out a pleasant
fragrance like those of the Bay-tree; they vary from an inch to
four inches long, and they may or may not bear stipules, but
if these are present they will be egg-shaped or oblong. The
stamens are normally five in each flower, but they vary up to
twelve. This is reputed to be of all our Willows the latest to
flower. A line drawn through York, Worcester, and North
Wales will give roughly its southward range as a native species.
South of that line it has been planted; north of it to the Scottish<!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
border it is a native. It has been found growing at a height of
1300 feet in Northumberland.</p>

<p>The Sallow (<i>Salix caprea</i>) is the only other species that can
properly be considered as a tree, as it attains to a height of
thirty feet, though fifteen to twenty feet is a more common
measurement. Its usually egg-shaped leaves vary from almost
round to elliptical or lance-shaped, and from two to four
inches in length. In the typical form, which occurs chiefly in
woods, dry pastures, and hedgerows, they are broad, smooth,
and dull-green above, covered with soft white down beneath;
the stipules half-kidney-shaped. This is the earliest of all our<!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Willows to flower, and the gold (male) and silver (female)
catkins are put out before the leaves. In the country, within
a few miles of the larger cities, this can hardly be a desirable
species to plant, for on the Sunday before Easter thousands
who at no other period exhibit any strong religious tendency
journey out to pick some "Palm," as they designate the Sallow
bloom, and the rough pruning the Sallows then get must in
many cases be disastrous. He who imagines that insect life is
suspended until spring is on the verge of summer should visit
the woods when the Sallow is in bloom; he will be astonished
at the swarms of bees and moths that are collecting the
abundant pollen or sipping the nectar provided for them.
Before the bright catkins can be seen the locality of the tree
may be known by the loud hum produced by hundreds of pairs
of wings. The all but invariable rule among the Willows&mdash;as
among Oaks, Beech, Birch, Hazel, and Pines&mdash;is to depend
upon the wind for the transfer of pollen from one tree to the
stigmas of another of the same species, but in the Sallow we
find a breaking away from what was doubtless the primitive
arrangement in all flowering plants, by the bribing with honey
of more reliable and less wasteful winged carriers.</p>

<p>The Gray Sallow (<i>Salix cinerea</i>) is really a sub-species of <i>S.
caprea</i>. It has a liking for moister places than the type, or
perhaps it would be more accurate to say that its growth in
moister situations has brought about the differences by which
it is separated from the parent form. These points are, briefly&mdash;the
buds and twigs are downy, the leaves smaller and proportionately
narrower, the upper surface downy, grey-green
beneath; the anthers of the male pale yellow, the capsule of the
female smaller.</p>

<p>The Eared Sallow (<i>S. aurita</i>) is probably also only another
form of <i>S. caprea</i>, distinguished by its small, bushlike proportions
(two to four feet high), long branches and red twigs; its
small wrinkled leaves, which are usually less than two inches<!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
long, are of an almost oblong shape, downy beneath, and with
large ear-shaped stipules. Its likeness is much closer to <i>S.
cinerea</i> than to the type; it is fond of damp copses and moist
places on heaths, where it may be found at considerable elevations.
In the Highlands it ascends to 2000 feet.</p>

<p>There are Willows of dwarf habit, some with long straggling
branches and more or less prostrate stems, that grow upon
heaths. Each has a name under which it has at some time or
other been ranked as a distinct species, just as the forms of
Bramble and Rose have been. The differences between them
are minute, and of little interest save to the advanced scientific
botanist, who with his dried specimens spread before him
often detects subtle distinctions not apparent to the outdoor
student of the living plant. For the purposes of those
for whom this volume is intended they may be regarded
as one.</p>

<p>Dwarf Silky Willow (<i>Salix repens</i>). It is a low bush from
six to twelve inches high, the stem lying along the ground.
Some of the branches straggle in the same fashion, but those
which bear the flowers are more or less erect. The leaf-buds
and the young leaves are silky, a condition that usually endures
on the lower surface, and in some forms on the upper also.
They are broadly or narrowly lance-shaped, varying in the
different forms alluded to above; in size they range from a half to
one and a half inches in length, and may have lance-shaped
stipules, or none at all. The scales of the catkins are yellowish-green
or purple, with dark tips. After they have shed their
pollen the anthers turn black. One form or other of this
species will be found in all parts of the British Islands where
there are heaths or commons; in the Highlands it occurs as
high as 2500 feet.</p>

<p>Another group of small Willows that form bushes (rarely a
small tree) have been united under two species&mdash;the Dark-leaved
Willow (<i>Salix nigricans</i>), and the Tea-leaved Willow<!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
(<i>Salix phylicifolia</i>). None of them occur south of Yorkshire,
and the chief distinction between the two species (?) consists in
the leaves of <i>S. nigricans</i> turning black when being dried for the
herbarium, whilst those of <i>S. phylicifolia</i> do not.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 462px;">
<a href="images/i_142.jpg"><img src="images/i_142_tn.jpg" width="462" height="400" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Osier.</span>
</div>

<p>The Osier (<i>Salix viminalis</i>). Many of the foregoing Willows,
when cut down low and induced to send out long, slender shoots,
are known as Osiers, but only two species are botanically regarded
as Osiers&mdash;this and the Purple Osier (<i>S. purpurea</i>).
The present species may remain as a shrub or grow into a small
tree, thirty feet high, with long, straight branches, which are
silky when young, but afterwards become polished. The leaves
vary in length from four to ten inches, and are slenderly lance-<!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>shaped,
tapering to a point in front, and narrowing into the
foot-stalk behind. They have waved margins without teeth,
and the upper surface netted with veins, the under surface
silvery and silky; stipules narrow lance-shaped. The Osier
may be seen in Osier-beds and wet places generally throughout
the country as far north as Elgin and Argyll. There are
several varieties and hybrids.</p>

<p>The Purple Osier (<i>Salix purpurea</i>). In all the other
Willows mentioned the stamens, whatever their number, all
have the filaments distinct from each other. In this species
alone the filaments of the two stamens are more or less
united. The Purple Osier gets its name from the red or purple
bark which clothes the thin but tough twigs. It is a shrub,
and grows from five to ten feet high. The leaves, which are
rather thin in texture, are from three to six inches long, of slender-lance-shape,
with toothed edges, smooth and glaucous on both
sides, but especially beneath, somewhat hairy when young.
They are almost opposite on the twigs, and when dried for the
herbarium turn black. There are several varieties of this shrub,
which were formerly honoured with specific rank.</p>

<p>There remains a group of several small species of very local
occurrence, with which we can do little more here beyond
naming them.</p>

<p>The Woolly Willow (<i>Salix lanata</i>) is a small shrub, two or three
feet high, with twisted branches, woolly twigs, and hairy black
buds. The broad egg-shaped or oblong leathery leaves are also
woolly, and two or three inches long. There are half-heart-shaped
stipules at the base of the very short leaf-stalk. It is an Alpine
plant, and is found about the mountain rills of Perth, Forfar,
Inverness, and Sutherland at elevations between 2000 and 2500
feet. Conspicuous in spring for its rich golden catkins. Sadler's
Willow (<i>S. sadleri</i>), of which only two or three specimens have
been found (in Glen Callater, 2500 feet), is probably a form of
this species.<!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lapland Willow (<i>Salix lapponum</i>) is of a similar proportion
to the last-named, sometimes erect, sometimes trailing.
Its leaves are more elliptic in shape, covered above with silky
hairs and below with cottony filaments. In <i>lanata</i> the raised
veins form a network pattern; in <i>lapponum</i> they are straight.
The stipules at the base of the long foot-stalk are small or
altogether wanting. Like the preceding species, it is restricted
to Scotch Alpine rocks, at elevations between 2000 and 2700
feet.</p>

<p>The Whortle-leaved Willow (<i>Salix myrsinites</i>) is a small, wiry,
creeping, or half-erect shrub, six inches to a foot high, with
toothed, dark glossy leaves, an inch or less in length, whose
net-veining shows on both sides. It is restricted to the Alpine
parts of mid-Scotland, from 1000 to 2700 feet.</p>

<p>The Small Tree-Willow (<i>Salix arbuscula</i>) is a small shrub,
whose stem creeps along the ground and roots as it goes, sending
up more or less erect branches a foot or two high. The downy
twigs are first yellow, then reddish-brown. The small leaves
vary from egg-shaped to lance-shaped, and are shining above
and glaucous beneath; toothed. In the Highlands of Aberdeen,
Argyll, Dumfries, Forfar, and Perth, between 1000 and 2400
feet.</p>

<p>The Least Willow (<i>Salix herbacea</i>) is not so restricted in its
range, for it is found in all parts of the United Kingdom where
there are heights sufficiently Alpine (2000 to 4300 feet) for its
tastes. It is only an inch or two high, and has consequently the
distinction of being the smallest British shrub. It is not so
herbaceous as it seems, or as its name implies, for its shrubby
stem and branches creep along underground, sending up only
short, scantly leaved twigs. The curled, roundish leaves do not
exceed half an inch in length; they are net-veined, toothed,
and shining. The catkins appear after the leaves.</p>

<p>The Net-leaved Willow (<i>Salix reticulata</i>) is another of the
Scotch Alpines. It is similar in habit to the last-named, but<!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
larger, its buried branches sending up twigs a foot long. The
roundish-oblong, leathery leaves are not toothed; they are
smooth above and glaucous beneath, strongly net-veined on
either side. The purplish or yellow catkins do not develop till
after the leaves. It is restricted to the mountains of Aberdeen,
Forfar, Inverness, Perth, and Sutherland.</p>

<p>The Weeping Willow (<i>Salix babylonica</i>), so conspicuous an
ornament of riverside lawns, is an introduced species, whose
slender branches hang downwards. It has large, lance-shaped,
finely toothed leaves, smooth above and glaucous
beneath. Further description of so well-known a tree is unnecessary.
It attains a height of forty to fifty feet. The name
<i>babylonica</i> was bestowed in the belief that its headquarters were
on the banks of the Euphrates. It is now known to be a native
of Japan, and other parts of Asia.</p>

<p>The name Willow is the Anglo-Saxon <i>welig</i>, indicating
pliancy, willingness.</p>


<h3>Our Native Conifers.</h3>

<p>The British flora is singularly poor in coniferous plants,
the Scots Pine, the Yew, and the Juniper being our only
native species, and even of these some authorities will have it
that the Yew is not truly a Conifer at all; they place it in a
separate order&mdash;<i>Taxace&aelig;</i>. For our present purpose, however,
although the Yew does not produce cones, it will be convenient
to keep it in its old position. The principal feature distinguishing
all Conifers and their allies (<i>Gymnosperms</i>) from other flowering
plants (<i>Angiosperms</i>) is briefly this: Angiosperms have their
incipient seeds (<i>ovules</i>) enclosed in a carpel, through which a
shoot from the pollen grain has to penetrate in order to reach and
fertilize the ovule. In Gymnosperms the carpel takes the form of
a leaf or bract, upon which the naked ovule lies open to actual<!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
contact with the pollen grain. After fertilization the carpel enlarges
to protect the seed, and becomes fleshy or woody, in the
latter case a group of carpels forming the well-known cones of
Pine or Fir.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="PLATE_73" id="PLATE_73"></a>
<a href="images/i_148.jpg"><img src="images/i_148_tn.jpg" width="400" height="293" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><i>Pl. 73.</i>
<br />
Yew.</span>
</div>

<p>In some of the groups (as the Yew, for example) the male or
pollen-producing flowers are borne by a separate tree from that
which bears the female or cone-producing flowers. In the Pines
both sexes are found on the same tree; but throughout the order
the pollen is carried by the wind. All the species are trees, or
shrubs. They are among the most valuable of timber trees, and,
in addition, yield a number of useful substances, such as pitch,
tar, turpentine, etc. The leaves are always rigid, extremely
narrow, and long in proportion: usually of the form that botanists
term linear, with the two sides parallel. In the Yews these leaves
spread out in two rows from opposite sides of the twigs; in the
Pines they are in clusters of two, three, or five, seeming to
be bound together at the base by a wisp of thin skin. The
number of leaves in each bundle is often a help in distinguishing
species.</p>

<p>The Yew (<i>Taxus baccata</i>) lacks the graceful proportions of
most of our trees, but it has for compensation a most obvious air
of strength and endurance. Who doubts, as he gazes at some
sombre Yew in the old churchyard, the story of the local
antiquarian, who tells him the tree has so stood for 2000 years. He
may, perhaps, mildly suggest that neither the church nor the
churchyard was in existence so far back, but even then the
antiquarian will probably have the last word by suggesting that
the grove of Yews of which this formed part was the church of
the past. Thousands see in cathedral aisles the reproduction in
stone of the pine-forest or the beech-wood. Standing before an
ancient Yew they may see whence came the idea for those
<i>clustered</i> columns. They actually exist in the bole of the Yew,
which presents the appearance not of a single trunk, but of
several trunks that have coalesced. This condition is due to the<!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Yew continually pushing out new shoots from the lower part of
its bole, which take an upright direction, and coalesce with the
old wood.</p>

<p>Although the Yew is a large tree, it is by no means a tall tree:
the height of full-grown Yews in this country ranging between
fifteen and fifty feet, though they are said to attain a greater
length in India. The bole of the Yew is short but massive,
covered with a thin red bark, that flakes off in patches much after
the manner of Plane-bark. Large specimens have a girth of from
twenty-five to fifty feet&mdash;or even more. Such a circumference
represents the growth of many centuries, for the annual growth-rings
are very thin. It is this very slow growth that produces
the hard, compact, and elastic wood that was so highly esteemed
in the days of the long-bow. Not only is the timber elastic and
strong, but it is exceedingly durable, so that it is said, "A post
of Yew will outlast a post of iron." Its branches start from the
trunk at only a few feet from the ground, and, taking an almost
horizontal direction, throw out a great number of leafy twigs,
which provide a dense and extensive shade. These leaves
are leathery in texture, curved somewhat after the manner
of a reaping-hook, shiny and dark above, pale and unpolished
below.</p>

</div>

<p>We have already mentioned that the Yew is a di&#339;cious tree&mdash;that
is, one whose male and female blossoms are borne on
separate trees&mdash;but the statement requires qualification to this
extent, that occasionally a tree will be found bearing a branch or
branches whose flowers are of the sex opposite to those covering
the greater part of the tree. The male catkin is almost round,
a quarter of an inch across, and contains about half a dozen
yellow anthers, the base surrounded by dry overlapping scales.
They may be found during February and March, in profusion on
the underside of the boughs. The female flower is much smaller,
and consists of a fleshy disk with a few scales at its base, and on
this stands a single seed-egg. After fertilization of the seed-egg<!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the disk develops into a red wax-like cup around the enlarging
seed with its olive-green coat. The flesh of the cup is full of
sweet mucilage, which makes the fruit acceptable to children,
but the flavour is rather too mawkish to suit older tastes. Yew-berries
are not poisonous, as sometimes supposed; neither is the
contained kernel, which has a pleasant nutty flavour. Much has
been said and written as to the toxic property of Yew-leaves, and
it appears that though cattle and goats may browse upon them
with impunity, horses and human beings pay the penalty of
death for such indulgence. That word toxic, by the way, owes
its significance to the Yew. The tree was named <i>taxus</i> in Latin,
from the Greek <i>toxon</i> (a bow), because of the ancient repute of
its wood for making that instrument. The tree was held to be<!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
poisonous, and so its name in the form of <i>toxicum</i> came to
designate all poisons.</p>

</div>

<p>There are some lines in <i>In Memoriam</i> which many readers
of Tennyson have found as obscure as the shade of the Yew
where they were conceived. The poet is addressing a venerable
churchyard Yew in these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Old warder of these buried bones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And answering now my random stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fruitful cloud and living smoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark Yew, that graspest at the stones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dippest towards the dreamless dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thee, too, comes the golden hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When flower is feeling after flower."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To any readers who have found a difficulty in understanding
these lines, we would say: visit the Yew groves in February
or March, when the male branches are thickly covered with
their yellow flowers, and strike a branch with your stick. In
response to the "random stroke" the pollen will fly off in a
"fruitful cloud" or "living smoke," some of it to be caught by
the minute female blossoms. This is the Yew-tree's "golden
hour, when flower is feeling after flower."</p>

<p>In the pre-gunpowder era, so important was it to have a
sufficient supply of suitable wood for the making of the dreaded
English long-bow, that the culture of the Yew was made the
subject of a number of royal ordinances, which, of course, were
allowed to drop out of observance when the bow was displaced
by the firearm. And now when men plant Yews they are mostly
the ornamental varieties, such as the Irish or Florence Court
Yew, which originated as a wild sport on the mountains of
Fermanagh about a hundred and forty years ago. Evelyn, it
is true, revived the interest in the Yew as an ornamental tree,
and it is with regret we add that at his suggestion it was first
put to the base use called topiary work, which had hitherto been
restricted to Box and Juniper. Evelyn showed how much more<!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
closely and continuously the Yew could be clipped without
affecting its vitality, and the fashion he thus set&mdash;and regarded as
a "merit"&mdash;was very generally followed during the next century.
Many of the atrocities of those days are still with us, but only as
survivals; and we can so often agree with Evelyn that we may
forgive him for having led our ancestors astray in this matter.
Evelyn was by no means blind to the good points of the tree in
its natural condition, as witness this quotation, which is as true
to-day as when it was written:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He that in winter should behold some of our highest hills in
Surry clad with whole woods of these two last sorts of trees [Box
and Yew], for divers miles in circuit (as in those delicious groves
of them, belonging to the Honourable, my Noble Friend, the late
Sir Adam Brown, of Bechworth Castle), from Box Hill, might,
without the least violence to his imagination, easily fancy himself
transported into some new or enchanted country; for if in any
spot in England,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">'tis here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eternal spring and summer all the year."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Along the chalk range of which the celebrated Box Hill forms
part will be found many fine examples of the Yew, as at Cherkley
Court, near Leatherhead, where there is an actual Yew forest.
There was a monstrous Yew at Brabourne in Kent, in Evelyn's
time, for he tells us he measured it, and found its girth to be only
one inch short of fifty-nine feet. There are numerous giants of
the species still living in quiet country churchyards, where they
have probably served&mdash;as tradition states of those at Fountains
Abbey&mdash;as a shelter for the builders of the ancient church during
its erection. It is reputed to be the longest-lived of all trees,
and it is to be hoped that no hindrance will be put in the way of
these connections of the present with the far past living to their
full natural limit, whatever it may be. It is naturally a tree of the
uplands and lower hills, and shows a distinct preference for soils
that contain plenty of lime.<!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>The Irish Yew (var. <i>fastigiata</i>), to which passing reference
was made, differs from the type in having all its branches growing
erectly, after the manner of a Lombardy Poplar, and in the leaves
being scattered promiscuously over the branchlets instead of
being in two regular rows. It attains a height of twenty to
twenty-five feet.</p>

<p>The Juniper (<i>Juniperus communis</i>) is seldom more than a
shrub a few feet in height, though it occasionally develops into
a small tree from ten to twenty feet high, and with a girth of five
feet. It has a fibrous red bark, which flakes off like that of the
Yew. The leaves are shaped like a cobbler's awl, rigid, and
end in sharp points. They have thickened margins, the concave
upper sides are glaucous, and they are arranged round the
branches in whorls of three. The male and female flowers are
on separate trees. The male catkin may be known in May by
its numerous anthers and pale yellow pollen. The female catkins
will be found in the axils of the leaves, and resemble buds.
The scales are fleshy, and after fertilization the upper ones
slowly develop into the form of a berry, which has a few undeveloped
scales at its base. They do not ripen until the
following year, when they are blue-black, covered with a fine
glaucous bloom. They have a pungent flavour, which is utilized
in concocting gin, which indeed owes its name to this fact&mdash;the
word being merely a contraction of <i>genévrier</i>, the French form
of Juniper. The "berries" have long been known as a kidney
stimulant&mdash;a fact which has been fully utilized as the justification
of every gin-drinker. A beautiful little moth&mdash;<i>Hypsilophus
marginellus</i>&mdash;may often be taken about the Juniper, upon which
its caterpillar feeds.</p>

<p>To appreciate the variety of forms assumed by the Juniper
according to the elevation at which it grows, it should be seen
on slopes like those of the North Downs in Surrey&mdash;one portion
of the range at Mickleham is named Juniper Hill. In the
valleys it may be found as a small shapely tree, higher up the<!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
slopes as a pyramidal shrub, and as we reach higher and more
exposed positions, the Juniper gradually dwindles to a low,
shapeless bush. This, however, must not be confounded with a
distinct variety to which the name <i>nana</i> has been applied; it
differs from the type in having shorter and broader overlapping
leaves, with curved tips. Var. <i>nana</i> is confined to the mountains
of the north of our islands, and ascends to 2700 feet, which
is 300 feet higher than is recorded of the type.</p>

<p><!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>The Virginian Juniper (<i>Juniperus virginiana</i>), or "Red Cedar,"
as it is called on the American continent, is a much larger plant,
which is frequently planted in our parks and gardens. It varies
in habit, and may be low and spreading, bush-like, or tall and
tapering, thirty to forty feet high. Its leaves are in threes, like
those of our native species, but the three are united by their bases.
It is with the red heart-wood of this tree that our "cedar" pencils
are covered, large quantities of the timber of <i>J. virginiana</i>,
and formerly of <i>J. bermudiana</i>, being imported for the purpose.
The Virginian Juniper has been with us for many years. It is
mentioned by Evelyn in his "Sylva" (1664), and is believed to
have been introduced by him from North America.</p>

Bole of Scots Pine.</span>
</div>

<p>The Scots Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>), commonly but incorrectly
styled Scotch Fir, is the typical Pine-tree of Northern Europe,
where (especially in Russia and Northern Germany) it constitutes
huge forests. It is even said to cover far wider tracts of
country than any other forest tree. Although there is evidence
that in ancient days it was pretty widely distributed over Britain,
to-day all those Pine-woods of Southern England are the results
of planting, and it is only in a few places between Yorkshire and
Sutherland, and in Ireland, that it can be regarded as truly wild
and indigenous. Mr. John Nisbet points out that the term
"pine-forest" is a bit of tautology, for the old German word <i>forst</i>
was derived from <i>foraha</i>&mdash;now represented by <i>föhre</i>, a fire or
pine&mdash;so that "pine-forest" is equivalent to "pine-pine." However,
the etymologists will probably allow us to speak of Pine-woods,
and we will try to remember that when we use the word
forest it must always indicate an assemblage of Pine-trees.</p>

<p>In favourable soil, at a moderate elevation, the Scots Pine is a
fine tree a hundred feet high, with a rough-barked trunk, whose
girth is twelve feet. Under such conditions it develops a strong
tap-root, which goes deep; but where the soil is shallow or
otherwise unfavourable the tap-root is not developed. At great
elevations the upward growth is checked early, and it becomes<!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
a mere evergreen bush. The branches are short and spreading,
those on the lower portions of the trunk dying early, so that the
tree soon gets that gaunt weather-beaten look that is so characteristic
of it. Then, after the growth of the leading shoot has
become feeble, the upper branches continue to lengthen, and so
bring about that flat-topped condition. Its growth is rapid,
and in twenty years it will attain a height of forty or fifty feet.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i_165.jpg"><img src="images/i_165_tn.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Scots Pine.</span>
</div>

<p>The leaves, which are in bundles of two, are from two to three
inches long, very slender, grooved above and convex beneath.
They remain on the tree for over two years, and in their
first season are of a glaucous hue, but in the second year this
changes to dark deep-green. Both male and female flowers are
borne by the same tree. The male catkins are individually
small (&frac14; inch), but are combined in spikes; this and the
abundant pale yellow pollen makes them conspicuous. The
female cones are somewhat egg-shaped, tapering to a point,
which is often curved. They are usually in clusters of three,
and grow to a length of two or three inches. The scales are
comparatively few, and their ends are thickened into an irregular
four-sided boss, at first ending in a little point. The seeds are
winged, and contained beneath the scales. They take about
eighteen months to ripen, when the scales separate in dry windy
weather, and allow the breeze to pick out the seeds and send
them flying through the air to a great distance. The pollen,
too, it should be noted, is of a form specially fitted for aerial
transport, each particle of pollen forming two connected spheres.
It is quite a common experience in May to find little heaps of
this pollen collected in hollows and at the margins of ponds in
the neighbourhood of Pine-woods; but, so difficult is it to get
people to understand the common facts of nature, that it is
generally regarded as evidence of a shower of brimstone having
fallen. It is not only the ignorant rustic who falls into this
error; judging from letters sent to the press by country parsons,
even the universities fail to prepare their alumni to deal with<!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
such phenomena. After the eruptions of La Soufriere, several
wrote to say that quantities of powdered sulphur from St.
Vincent had descended in their Surrey and Hampshire parishes!
their notion being that the commercial "flowers of sulphur" are
the direct produce of volcanoes.</p>

<p>Although the wood produced by the Scots Pine in this country
is not considered of the highest quality, the species is certainly<!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of equal value as a timber-producer with any other tree. Owing
to our mild winters and long periods of seasonal growth, the
Pine-wood produced in Britain is coarse-grained and not very
durable. In the colder parts of Northern Europe, where
summers are short and the long winters are severe, the texture
of the timber is more solid and the grain closer. And so
enormous quantities of Pine-wood come to us from the Baltic
ports every year. In addition to the timber, other valuable
substances known to commerce are products of the Scots Pine&mdash;pitch
and tar, resin and turpentine, for example. The Pine
is an accommodating tree, for though it likes a deep soil in
which to strike its tap-root, it will grow upon rocky ground,
where the roots have to become horizontal and near the surface;
or it will form forests on poor sandy soils, even on the
loose hot sands near the seashore. This is a valuable power,
because the fall of its needles gradually forms a humus, and so
provides food for other plants which could not exist on raw
sand.</p>

<p>Other coniferous trees that have become more or less familiar
in our plantations and parks will be found in the second division
of this book.</p>

<h3>The Holly (<i>Ilex aquifolium</i>).</h3>

<p>The Holly must be regarded as one of our small trees,
although many specimens attain a height of forty or fifty feet,
with a girth of ten or twelve feet. It is well distributed throughout
our islands, ascending to a thousand feet, and it is probable that
no other tree is so well known, by its foliage at least, as the Holly,
or Holm, to give it its ancient name. The word Holm was incorporated
by some of our ancestors far back in the name
Holmsdale, which still attaches to the stretch of country at the
southern foot of the chalk hills in Surrey, and whose proud
motto is, "Never wonne, ne never shall." At the western end<!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of the Holmsdale is Holmwood, and still a little further west
Holmbury. In these places the Holly still grows bravely, not
far from the old home of John Evelyn, who must be thought of
whenever we talk of Hollies, though the recollection has to do
with Sayes Court, his Thames-side house, where the barbarian
Peter wrought such havoc with his cherished Holly-hedge. How
Evelyn must have lamented that outrage is indicated in this
extract from the "Sylva":&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is there under heaven a more glorious and refreshing object
of the kind, than an impregnable hedge of about four hundred feet
in length, nine feet high, and five in diameter, which I can show
in my now ruined gardens at Say's Court (thanks to the Czar of<!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Moscovy) at any time of the year, glittering with its armed and
varnished leaves? The taller standards at orderly distance,
blushing with their natural coral. It mocks the rudest assaults
of the weather, beasts, or hedge-breakers, <i>et illum nemo impunè
lacessit</i>."</p>

<span class="caption">Holly.</span>
</div>

<p>The bark of the Holly is smooth and pale-grey in colour.
Time out of mind it has been used in the preparation of a viscid
substance known as birdlime, which, spread on twigs, holds the
feet of small birds. Respecting the foliage of the Holly, there
is little need to say anything, but for uniformity's sake we may
note that the leaves are oval in shape, of a leathery consistence,
with a firmer margin, running out into long sharp spines. It is
a fact worthy of note that when the Holly has attained to a
height of ten feet or so, it frequently clothes its upper branches
in leaves that have no spines&mdash;a circumstance that Robert
Southey sought to explain in his poem "The Holly-tree," on
teleological grounds. His second verse, however, contains
sufficient explanation of the fact it describes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Below, a circling fence, its leaves are seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrinkled and keen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No grazing cattle through their prickly round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can reach to wound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, as they grow where nothing is to fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smooth and unarm'd the pointless leaves appear."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In some places the young shoots are gathered by the peasants,
dried, bruised, and used as a winter cattle-food. No doubt, in
the early history of the Holly, cattle found out its good qualities
for themselves, and browsed upon the then-unarmed foliage. In
self-defence the tree developed spines upon its leaves, and so
kept its enemies at a respectful distance. Above the reach of
these marauders the production of spines would be a useless
waste of material.</p>

Flowers of Holly.</span>
</div>

<p>The flowers of the Holly, though small, are conspicuous by
their great number and white colour. They are about a quarter<!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of an inch across, with four petals and four stamens or stigmas.
Sometimes flowers with stamens are produced by the same tree
that bears flowers with stigmas; but often the male and the female
flowers are borne by separate trees, so that the possessor of a
Holly that is solely male is sometimes puzzled by the fact that
his tree, though covered with blossom, never produces a berry.
The fruit is analogous in structure to that of the Plum and
Cherry, and is technically termed a <i>drupe</i>; but instead of the
single stone of these fruits, in the Holly-berry there are four
bony little stones, each with its contained seed. The berries
ripen about September, and are then scarlet and glossy, though
here and there one finds a tree whose fruit never gets beyond
the yellow stage of coloration.</p>

<p>Most parts of the tree have had their uses in medicine; the
leaves, for example, being said to have value as a febrifuge, and
the berries as a purgative, or in large doses (6 to 8) as an
emetic. The smooth bark of large Hollies is often attacked
by one of the most striking of our native lichens&mdash;<i>Graphis
elegans</i>&mdash;whose black fruiting portions look like a raised cuneiform
inscription. The Holly is not greatly subject to the attacks
of insects, but many of its leaves will be found to have been
tunnelled between the upper and lower skins by the larva of a
minute moth, one of the Leaf-miners. It also provides the
pabulum for the caterpillar of the Holly-blue butterfly (<i>Lyc&aelig;na
argiolus</i>). The dead leaves may be examined for the minute
Prickly Snail (<i>Helix aculeata</i>).</p>

<p>The wood of the Holly has an exceedingly fine grain, due to
its slow growth, and it is very hard and white. These qualities
make it valuable for many purposes, often as a substitute for
Box-wood, and, when dyed black, in lieu of Ebony.<!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

Spindle&mdash;winter.</span>

<h3>The Spindle-tree (<i>Euonymus europ&aelig;us</i>).</h3>

<p>The Spindle is right on the borderland between trees and
shrubs, for though it will grow into a tree twenty feet high, yet
our hedgerow specimens are usually bushlike, and only ten or
twelve feet high. Until the autumn the Spindle, we fear, is
rarely recognized as such, but gets confused with Buckthorn and
Dogwood. In October, however, its quaint fruits have changed
to a pale crimson hue, which renders them the most conspicuous
feature of a hedgerow&mdash;even of one plentifully
decorated with scarlet hips and haws and bryony-berries.
The unusual tint of the Spindle, and the fact that it swings on
a slender stalk, at once mark it out from the rigid-stalked hips
and haws.</p>

<span class="caption">Spindle-tree.
<br />
A, flowers.</span>
</div>

<p>The trunk of the Spindle is clothed in smooth grey bark. The
twigs, which are in pairs, starting from opposite sides of a branch,
are four-angled. The shining leaves vary from egg-shaped to
lance-shaped, with finely-toothed edges. They are arranged in
pairs, and in autumn they change to yellow and red. When
bruised they give off a f&oelig;tid odour, the juice is acrid, and said
to be poisonous&mdash;a charge which is laid against the bark, flowers,
and seed as well. The small greenish-white flowers are borne
in loose clusters, of the type known as cymes, from the axils of
the leaves, and appear in May and June. Some contain both
stamens and pistil, but others are either stamenate <i>or</i> pistillate.
The calyx is cut into four or six parts, the petals and stamens
agree with these parts in number, but the lobes of the stigma only
range from three to five, corresponding with the cells of the
ovary. The fruit is deeply lobed, and marked with grooves,
indicating the lines of future division, when the lobes open and
disclose the seeds, at first covered with their orange jackets,
or <i>arils</i>, after the manner of the mace that encloses the
nutmeg.</p>

<p><!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>The hardness and toughness of Spindle-wood has long been
esteemed in the fashioning of small wares where these qualities
are essential, and the common name is a survival of the days
when spinning was the occupation of every woman. Then
spindles were in demand for winding the spun thread upon, and
no wood was more suitable than that of Euonymus for making
them. It shares with the Cornel (<i>Cornus sanguinea</i>) the name
Dogwood; it is also Skewerwood, Prickwood, and Pegwood,
all suggestive of uses to which it is or was applied. The young
shoots make a very fine charcoal for artists' use.<!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spindle is indigenous throughout our islands, but cannot
be said to be generally common; it is rarer in Scotland and
Ireland than in England.</p>

<p>Among the exotic species cultivated in our parks and gardens
are the handsome variegated forms of the Evergreen Spindle
(<i>Euonymus japonicus</i>) of China and Japan, and the Broad-leaved
Spindle (<i>E. latifolius</i>) from Europe.</p>

<h3>The Buckthorns (<i>Rhamnus</i>).</h3>

<p>Our two native species of Buckthorn are shrubs of from five
to ten feet in height. In this one respect they agree; in almost
all others they differ. Both are Buckthorns in name, but the
Breaking Buckthorn (<i>Rhamnus frangula</i>) is quite unarmed,
whilst many of the branchlets of the Purging Buckthorn
(<i>Rhamnus catharticus</i>) are hardened into spines.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i_185.jpg"><img src="images/i_185_tn.jpg" width="400" height="306" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Purging Buckthorn.
<br />
A, flowers.</span>
</div>

<p>The Purging Buckthorn is distinguished by its stiff habit, and
by some of the leaves being gathered into bundles at the ends
of the shoots. The leaves are egg-shaped, with toothed edges,
and of a yellowish-green tint, with short leaf-stalks. The
yellowish-green flowers are very small, and will be found both
singly and in clusters from the leaf-axils. There are a four-cleft
calyx, four petals, four stamens, or four stigmas, for the
sexes are usually on separate plants. The fruit is black, round,
and about a quarter of an inch across, containing four stones.
These so-called "berries" are ripe in September. Formerly
they were much used as a purging medicine, but of so violent a
character that their use has come to be discouraged, and the
safer syrup of Buckthorn is prescribed instead. The juice of
these berries is the raw material from which the artist's sap-green
is prepared. It may be found in woods, thick hedgerows,
and bushy places on commons southward of Westmoreland,
showing a decided preference for chalky soils. In Ireland it
only occurs rarely.</p>

<p>The Breaking Buckthorn (<i>Rhamnus frangula</i>) is also known<!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
as the Berry-bearing Alder, its leaves, with their lateral veins,
presenting something of the appearance of the Alder. Its
more slender stems are purplish-brown in hue, and <i>all</i> the
leaves are arranged alternately up the stems. The leaves
further differ from those of <i>R. catharticus</i> in having plain, un-toothed
edges, and their veins parallel one to another. The
flowers are similar in size to those of the other species, but are
whiter, less yellow, fewer in number, and on longer stalks. The
parts of the flower, too, are in fives instead of fours; and the
"berry," though similar to the previous species, is much larger
(half-inch diameter). In an unripe condition these fruits yield a
good green dye, much used by calico printers and others. The<!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
wood made into charcoal is said to be the best for the purposes
of the gunpowder makers, who know it by the name of Black
Dogwood. The straight shoots of both species are used for
forming walking and umbrella sticks, and those of longer
growth for pea and bean sticks.</p>

<p>The Brimstone butterfly (<i>Gonepteryx rhamni</i>) lays its eggs on
the leaves of <i>R. frangula</i>, upon which the larva feeds. The
name Buckthorn appears to be due to an ancient misunderstanding
of the German name Buxdorn, which should have
been translated Box-thorn.</p>

<h3>Wild Plums (<i>Prunus communis</i>).</h3>

<p>With the single exception of the Hazel, all our native fruit-trees
are members of the extensive and beautiful Rose family. Before
Roman invasions brought improved and cultivated varieties,
our "rude forefathers" must have been glad to eat the Sloes,
Crabs, and Wild Cherries that are now regarded as too terribly
crude and austere, in an uncooked condition, for any stomach
but that of the natural boy, which appears capable of surviving
any ill-treatment. Some authors have regarded the Wild Plum
and the Bullace as being specifically distinct from the Sloe and
from each other; but the modern view is that their differences
only entitle them to rank as sub-species of the Sloe, and as
such they will be regarded here.</p>

<span class="caption">Blackthorn.
<br />
A, flowers.</span>
</div>

<p>The Sloe or Blackthorn (<i>Prunus communis</i>) is the rigid
many-branched shrub, with stiletto-like tips, that luxuriates on
some of our commons and in our hedgerows. The blackish
bark that gives its name to the shrub forms a fine foil in March
or April for the pure white starry blossoms that brave the cold
blasts before the leaf-buds dare unfurl their coverings. In some
places&mdash;as in Cornwall, where it is the principal hedge plant,
and where cliffs, creeks, and river banks are bordered by it&mdash;these
bare black or purple stems are almost hidden by the<!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
abundant growth of the Grey Lichen (<i>Evernia prunastri</i>). In
this, the typical form, the branches and twigs turn in every
direction, so that it is impossible to thrust one's hand into a
Blackthorn bush without getting considerably scratched. The
well-known flower consists of a five-lobed calyx, five white petals,
and from fifteen to twenty stamens round the single carpel.
The stigma matures in advance of the stamens, so that it has
usually been fertilized by bee-borne pollen from another Sloe
before its own anthers have disclosed their pollen. The fruit
is about half an inch across, globose in form, and held erect<!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
upon its short stalk; black, but its blackness hidden by a
delicate "bloom" that gives it a purplish glaucous hue.
Terribly harsh are these fruits to the palate, and a mere bite
at an unripe one is sufficient to set teeth on edge and contract the
muscles of mouth and face. And yet, when the tight jacket of
the Sloe begins to relax and pucker, the juice condenses into
more mealy flesh, and the acridity passes, one may <i>eat</i> not
one but a dozen, slowly, enjoying the piquancy of each before
swallowing. Country people make them into wine, and it used
to be said that much that is sold as port had its origin in the
skins of British sloes instead of Portuguese grapes. And for
special use "for the stomach's sake" old-wife followers of St.
Paul pin their faith to gin in which Sloes have soaked for
months.</p>

<p>In the days of our youth it was a stock jibe against the grocer
that most of his China tea had been grown on Blackthorn
bushes not far from home, and with tea at five or six shillings a
pound there may have been some basis of truth for the belief;
but with the prices of to-day it may be presumed that Blackthorn
leaves would cost the dealer at least as much as real tea-leaves
from Assam and Darjeeling.</p>

<p>The Bullace (<i>Prunus communis</i>, sub-sp. <i>insititia</i>) differs
from the Sloe in having <i>brown</i> bark, the branches <i>straight</i> and
only a few of them ending in spines, the leaves larger, broader,
more coarsely toothed, and downy on the underside. The
flowers, too, have broader petals, and the fruit&mdash;which may be
black or yellow&mdash;droops, and is between three-quarters and one
inch in diameter. In many places where this grows it can only
be regarded as an escape from cultivation.</p>

<p>The Wild Plum (<i>Prunus communis</i>, sub-sp. <i>domestica</i>) has
also brown bark, its branches straight, and not ending in spines.
The downiness noticed on the underside of the Bullace leaves
is here restricted to the ribs of the leaf. The fruit attains a
diameter of an inch or an inch and a half. Although found<!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
occasionally in hedgerows, this sub-species is not indigenous in
any part of our islands. Hooker says the only country in
which it is really indigenous is Western Asia; but its numerous
cultivated forms are widely distributed.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the fruits of the Blackthorn and its
sub-species are formed within the flower; so are those of the
Cherries, to be next described, the ovary being botanically
termed "superior," that is, above the base of the calyx and
corolla, when the flower is in an erect position. This is a point of
some importance when one seeks to understand the different
formation of the fruit in so closely related a species as the Apple,
in which the ovary is "inferior," or below the flower.</p>


<h3>Wild Cherries (<i>Prunus avium</i>).</h3>

<p>Nature has been comparatively lavish in the matter of
Cherries, for she has bestowed three species upon the British
Islands. For the cultivated Cherry it is said that we ought
to thank the Romans, as for many other good things in the
way of food. Pliny states that we had the Cherry in Britain by
the middle of the first century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> Evelyn tells us that the
Cherry orchards of Kent owe their origin to "the plain industry
of one Richard Haines, a printer to Henry VIII.," by whom
"the fields and environs of about thirty towns, in Kent only,
were planted with fruit trees from Flanders, to the unusual
benefit and general improvement of the county to this day."
It is probable, however, that our own countrymen had already
effected some improvement on the wild sorts by cultivation,
for even in the woods some trees are found bearing fruit much
larger and of better flavour than usual, and such would be
selected for cultivation.</p>

Flowers of Gean.</span>
</div>

<p>Our three natives are the Wild or Dwarf Cherry (<i>Prunus
cerasus</i>), the Gean (<i>P. avium</i>), and the Bird Cherry (<i>P. padus</i>).<!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Of these the Gean is the species most widely distributed
throughout our country, and we therefore give it precedence.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">Gean.
<br />

</div>

<p>The Gean (<i>Prunus avium</i>) is a tree that in suitable soils
attains a height of thirty or forty feet, with short, stout branches,
that take an upward direction. The leaves are large, broadly
oval, with sharp-toothed edges, and downy on the underside.
They always droop from the branches, and in spring they are
of a bronzy-brown tint, which afterwards changes to pale green.
Soon after the leaves have unfolded they are almost hidden
by the umbels of wide-open white flowers, which have soft,
heart-shaped petals, and whose anthers and stigmas mature
simultaneously. The firm-fleshed drupe is heart-shaped, black<!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
or red, sweet or bitter, with scanty juice which stains the fingers.
This is believed to be the original wild stock from which our
modern Black Hearts and Bigarreau Cherries have been
evolved by the cultivator.</p>

<p>The Dwarf or Wild Cherry (<i>Prunus cerasus</i>) is more bush-like
than tree-like, for it sends up a great number of suckers
around the main stem. The branches are slender and drooping.
The leaves, which are of similar shape to those of <i>P. avium</i>,
are smooth and deep blue-green in tint, with round-toothed
edges. The flowers are not so widely open as in the previous
species, but retain more of the cup-shape, whilst the notched
petals are firmer in consistence and oval in shape. The drupe<!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
is in this species round, with red skin and juicy flesh of a
distinctly acid character. The juice does not stain as does
that of <i>P. avium</i>. The Morello or Brandy Cherry, the May
Duke, and the Kentish Cherries are considered to be derived
from this species. This does not extend further north than
Yorkshire; in Ireland it is rare.</p>

Bole of Bird Cherry.</span>
</div>

<p>The Bird Cherry (<i>Prunus padus</i>) forms a tree from ten to
twenty feet in height, with more elliptic leaves, which have
their edges doubly cut into fine teeth. The flowers are not
clustered in umbels, as in both the foregoing, but in a loose
raceme from lateral spurs of new growth. The flowers are
erect when they open, and the stigmas mature before the
anthers, so that cross-fertilization is favoured in this species.
After fertilization the flower droops, to be out of the way of the
bees in their visits to the unfertilized blossoms. The petals
in this species look as if their edges had been gnawed. The
drupes are small, black, and very bitter, with a wrinkled stone.
This is a northern species, coming not further south than
Leicestershire and South Wales. All three species flower in
late April or early May.</p>

<p>Cherry wood is strong, fine-grained, and of a red colour. It
is easily worked, and susceptible of a high polish, so that it is
in request by cabinet-makers, turners, and musical instrument
makers.</p>

Wild Pear&mdash;spring.</span>
</div>


<h3>The Wild Pear (<i>Pyrus communis</i>).</h3>

<p>The Wild Pear is only to be found growing in the southern
half of Britain, its northward range not extending beyond
Yorkshire, and even in the south its claim to be regarded as a
true native has been contested. Mr. Hewett C. Watson regards
it as more probably a denizen, that is, a species originally
introduced by man, which has maintained its hold upon the<!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
new land. Upon this assumption it is probable that the introduced
specimens were already somewhat cultivated, but when
they (or their descendants) became wild they reverted to the
original condition of the species.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i_203.jpg"><img src="images/i_203_tn.jpg" width="400" height="314" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Wild Pear.
<br />
A, flower.</span>
</div>

<p>The Wild Pear, or Choke-pear, is a small tree, from twenty
to sixty feet in height, of somewhat pyramidal form. The twigs,
which are usually of a drooping tendency, are also much given
to ending in spines&mdash;a character scarcely apparent in the
cultivated tree. The leaves, too, of the wild tree are more
distinctly toothed than those of the Garden Pear. They are
oval in shape, with blunt-toothed edges, and downy on the
lower surface. Along the new shoots the leaves are arranged
alternately on opposite sides, but on shoots a year old they are<!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
produced in clusters. The flowers, which measure more than
an inch across, are pure white in colour, and are clustered in
cymes of five to nine. They appear in April and May, and are of
the Wild Rose type, there being numerous stamens, from three
to five styles, which ripen before the stamens, five petals, and
the calyx, taking the form of a pitcher with a five-lobed mouth,
represents the five sepals.</p>

<p>In speaking of the Wild Plums we directed attention to the
fact that the ovary was within the flower; in the Pear (and the
other members of the genus <i>Pyrus</i>) it is below the flower, hidden
away in fact within the calyx-tube. When the flower opens it
is ready for fertilization, but as the stamens of that flower are
not yet mature this can only be accomplished by pollen brought
by the bees from other flowers as they rifle the honey-glands.
The effect of pollination is to cause special vegetative activity
in the neighbourhood of the ovary, resulting in the thickening
of the flesh of the calyx-tube around it, until it has become of
the characteristic pear-shape, and an inch or two in length. A
section of a pear or apple, taken lengthwise, will show a faint
green outline of the ovary, and will demonstrate how much
of the flesh is really belonging to the calyx-tube. The fruit of the
Wild Pear is green until about November, when it turns yellow.
It is of too harsh a character to be fit for eating.</p>

<p>A Pear formerly known as a variety (<i>briggsii</i>) of <i>Pyrus communis</i>
is now regarded as a distinct species under the name of
<i>Pyrus cordata</i>. It is found in Cornwall, and is distinguished by
its more oval leaves being rounded at the base, and by its much
smaller fruits being often globular.</p>

<p>The Pear is a long-lived tree, that grows singly or in small
groups on dry plains. It attains a height of about fifty feet in
thirty years, and its girth may then be three or four feet. The
timber is fine-grained, strong and heavy, with a reddish tinge.
Stained with black, it is used to counterfeit ebony.</p>

<h3>The Wild Apple (<i>Pyrus malus</i>).</h3>

<p>It is by no means an easy matter to decide whether the
Crab-trees that grow along the hedgerows are truly wild or the
offspring of orchard apples. In woods, away from gardens and
orchards, there is less difficulty. Like the Pear, the Apple
appears to have been the subject of cultural attention from very
early times. This is proved by the philologists from the similarity
of the equivalents for our word Apple in all the Celtic and
Sclavonian languages, showing by their common origin that the
fruit was of sufficient importance to have a distinctive name
long before the separation of the peoples of Northern Europe.
The name of Crab is of comparatively recent origin. Prior
regards it as a form of the Lowland Scotch <i>scrab</i>, derived from
Anglo-Saxon <i>scrobb</i>, a shrub, indicating that it is an Apple-bush
rather than an Apple-tree.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i_208.jpg"><img src="images/i_208_tn.jpg" width="400" height="359" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Crab or Wild Apple.
<br />
A, flower; B, fruit.</span>
</div>

<p>The Wild Apple has not the pyramidal form of the Wild Pear,
the branches spreading more widely when young and drooping
when older, so that the head is rounded. In height it varies as
a tree from twenty to thirty feet, though many examples of good
age still retain the dimensions of a bush. Owing to the spreading
character of the branches, the diameter of the head often
exceeds the height of the tree. The bole has seldom any pretensions
to symmetry, and is usually more or less crooked like
the older branches. The brown bark is not very rough, though
its numerous fissures and cracks give it a rugged appearance.
Its wood, like that of the Pear, is hard and fine-grained, but,
instead of having a reddish tinge, there is a tendency to brownness.
The leaves vary in shape, but are more or less oblong,
smooth above, sometimes downy on the lower surface when
young, and with toothed edges.</p>

<p>The flowers are about the same size as those of the Wild Pear,
but their white petals are beautifully tinted and streaked with<!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
pink. The small clusters are umbels&mdash;that is to say, the footstalks
of similar length start from a common base. The fruit
is almost spherical, and instead of the foot-stalk gradually merging
into the apple, the attachment is always in a depression of
the latter. In the typical form of the Wild Apple the yellow and
red fruit hang by their slender stalks, but there is a variety (<i>mitis</i>)
in which the fruit is borne <i>above</i> the stouter stalks. The variety
may also be known by the downiness of the young leaves, the
calyx-tube, and the stalks. The fruit is about an inch across,
and so rich in malic acid as to be unfit for food in its natural<!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
state, though children punish their digestive organs with it. Pigs
are partial to Crab-apples, a taste they have evidently inherited
from the wild boar. A delicious preserve, called Crab-jelly, is
made by stewing the whole fruit, then pressing the soft flesh
through a hair sieve, and boiling the pulp with sugar. Cyder is
made from the rotting Crabs; also a kind of vinegar called
verjuice, or vargis.</p>

<p>The Wild Apple is found all over the United Kingdom as far
north as the Clyde, and wherever it is known to occur it is worth
a special visit in May, when all its crooked branches and
straggling shoots are rendered beautiful by the abundance of
delicately tinted and fragrant flowers. It is also far from being
unattractive in the autumn, when the miniature apples hang
from the boughs.</p>

<h3>White Beam (<i>Pyrus aria</i>).</h3>

<p>Owing to its very local occurrence, the White Beam, though
widely distributed, is one of the less known of our trees and
shrubs. It comes into both these categories according to the
situation of its growth, for whilst in exposed mountainous
localities a specimen of mature age may be no more than four
or five feet high, and of bush-like growth, under the lee of a
wood, and on a calcareous soil, it will be an erect and graceful
tree of pyramidal form, whose apex is forty feet from the ground.
In its early years growth is tolerably rapid, but at the age of
ten it slackens pace, and after it has attained its majority its
progress is very slow. Its wood is fine-grained, very hard, white,
but inclining to yellow. The bark is smooth, and little subject
to the cracks and fissures that mark the Apple-bark. The
branches, except a few of the lowest, all have an upward
tendency.</p>

<span class="caption">White Beam.
<br />
A, fruits.</span>
</div>

<p>The leaves vary considerably in the several forms or sub-species,
but in the typical form they are a broad oval, with the edges<!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
coarsely toothed or cut into lobes, the upper side smooth, and the
lower side clothed with white cottony down, the almost straight
nerves strongly marked. The white flowers, which appear in May
or June, are only half an inch across, and gathered into loose
clusters. They are succeeded by nearly round scarlet fruits, half
an inch in diameter, known in Lancashire and Westmoreland
as Chess-apples. The tree is also known in the same districts
as Sea Owler, the latter word, according to Prior, being a
corruption of Aller or Alder, probably from the resemblance of
the plaited leaves to those of <i>Alnus glutinosa</i>. These Chess-apples
are very sharp and rough to the taste, but when kept<!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
like Medlars, till they "blet" or begin to decay, are far from
unpleasant. Birds and squirrels eagerly seek for them on the
tree, and those that fall are as welcome to hedgehogs and other
mammals. This form is only found from the Midlands to the
South of England as far west as Devon, and in Ireland.</p>

<p>The sub-species <i>latifolia</i> (<i>Pyrus rotundifolia</i> of some
botanists) has broader leaves, varying from oval-oblong to
almost round, divided into wedge-shaped lobes, the cottony
down beneath being grey rather than white, and the nerves
less prominent on the underside. This form is found in
Cornwall.</p>

<p>The sub-species <i>scandica</i> (also known as <i>Pyrus intermedia</i>)
has the leaves less tough, more deeply divided into rounded or
oblong lobes, and the grey cotton beneath of a looser character.
This form is found in Scotland.</p>

<p>It should be noted that this species must not be called the
White Beam-<i>tree</i>, for the word <i>beam</i> is the Saxon equivalent for
tree. Other names for it include Hen-apple, Cumberland
Hawthorn, Hoar Withy, Quick Beam, and Whipcrop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Wild Service</span> (<i>Pyrus torminalis</i>) is a small tree of
local occurrence, which does not extend further north than
Lancashire. In general appearance it may be taken for the
White Beam, but closer inspection will reveal the following
differences. The leaves, which are cut into tapering lobes and
coarsely toothed, are heart-shaped at the base; when young
they are slightly downy beneath, but when mature they are
smooth on both sides. Though the flowers are similar in size
and colour to those of the White Beam, the fruit is smaller
(one-third inch in diameter), less globular, and more like a large
haw, though the colour is greenish-brown. The flowers appear
in April and May, and the fruit, which is of a very dry, juiceless
character, is ripe in November. In some localities these fruits
are marketed, but they require to be kept like Medlars, until
decay sets in, before they are fit to be eaten.</p>

<h3>Mountain Ash, or Rowan (<i>Pyrus aucuparia</i>).</h3>

<p>Little description of the Mountain Ash is needed, for in recent
years it has come so much into favour that it is now one of the
commonest of the trees planted in little suburban gardens and
fore-courts. Its hardiness, its indifference to the character of
the soil, the fact that other plants will grow beneath it, and the
absence of need for pruning&mdash;all these points unite to make it
suitable and popular for growth in restricted spaces. But the
wood on the hillside is the natural home of the Mountain Ash,
and in the Highlands its vertical range extends to 2600 feet
above sea-level.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 271px;">

<span class="caption">Rowan, or Mountain Ash.

</div>

<p>The Mountain Ash attains a height of from thirty to fifty feet,
and has a straight clean bole, clothed in smooth grey bark,
scarred horizontally as though it had been scored with a knife.
All the branches have an upward tendency, and the shoots
bear the long feathery leaves, whose division into six or eight
pairs of slender leaflets suggests <i>the</i> Ash, from which part of its
name has been borrowed. Gazing on this tree either in flower
or fruit, it would be quite unnecessary to explain that it is not
even remotely allied to <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>, and that the
similarity of leaf-division is the only point of resemblance between
them. These leaflets have toothed edges, are paler on the
underside, and in a young condition the midrib and nerves
are hairy. The creamy-white fragrant flowers are like little
Hawthorn blossoms, though only half the size, and they appear
in dense clusters (<i>cymes</i>) in May or June. The fruit are
miniature apples, of the size of holly-berries, bright scarlet
without and yellow within. They ripen in September, and are
then a great attraction to thrushes, blackbirds, and their kind,
who rapidly strip the tree of them. Though this at first sight
may appear like frustrating the tree's object in producing fruit,
it is not really so, the attractive flesh being a mere bait to induce
the birds to pass the seeds through their intestines, and thus<!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
get them sown far and wide. By this method the process of
germination is considerably hastened, whereas by hand-sowing
the seeds lie in the earth for eighteen months before shooting.
All the species of <i>Pyrus</i> produce their fruits with this object,
the larger more or less brownish ones being intended to attract
mammals, the smaller and red-coloured to tempt birds. The
seeds have leathery jackets to protect them from the action of
the digestive fluids, and are further wrapped in a parchmenty,
bony, or wooden "core" (<i>endocarp</i>) with a similar object. In
the case of the Rowan this is very like wood.</p>

<p>In the south of Britain the Mountain Ash is chiefly grown as
underwood and used as a nurse for oaks and other timber trees,
which soon outgrow it and kill it; so that in the woods it is<!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
seldom allowed to grow into a fully developed tree, but, thanks
to the birds, it comes up on the common and the hillside, and
has a chance of producing its masses of ruby fruit. Its wood is
tough and elastic, but, owing to the smallness of its girth, it does
not produce timber of any size. Still, it makes admirable poles
and hoops.</p>

<p>The word Rowan is one of the most interesting of tree-names,
and connects the still-existing superstitious practices of our
northern counties, not only with the old Norsemen, but with the
ancient Hindus who spoke the Sanskrit tongue. The word is
spelled in many ways which connect it with the Old Norse <i>runa</i>,
a charm, it being supposed to have power to ward off the effects
of the evil eye. In earlier times <i>runa</i> was the Sanskrit appellation
for a magician; <i>rûn-stafas</i> were staves cut from the Rowan-tree
upon which runes were inscribed. Until quite recently the
respect for its magical properties was shown in the north by fixing
a branch of Rowan to the cattle-byre as a charm against the
evil designs of witches, warlocks, and others of that kidney. In
this connection we may quote also from Evelyn's "Sylva." He
says: "Ale and beer brewed with these berries, being ripe, is
an incomparable drink, familiar in Wales, where this tree is
reputed so sacred that there is not a churchyard without one
of them planted in it (as among us the Yew); so, on a certain
day in the year, everybody religiously wears a cross made of the
wood; and the tree is by some authors called Fraxinus Cambro-Britannica,
reputed to be a preservative against fascinations
and evil spirits; whence, perhaps, we call it witchen, the boughs
being stuck about the house or the wood used for walking-staves."</p>

<p>Among the numerous names of the Mountain Ash are
Fowler's Service (or Servise, from <i>Cerevisia</i>, a fermented
drink), Cock-drunks, Hen-drunks (from the belief that fowls
were intoxicated by eating the "berries"), Quickbeam, White
Ash (from the colour of the flowers), Witch-wood, and Witchen.<!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Quickbeam is in allusion to the constant movement of foliage,
quick being the Anglo-Saxon <i>cwic</i>, alive. Witch-wood and
Witchen are also forms of <i>cwic</i>.</p>

<p>The True Service (<i>Pyrus sorbus</i>) closely resembles the
Mountain Ash in habit and foliage, but it is not a native of
Britain, though it used to be claimed as such, on account of
its growing in the more mountainous parts of Cornwall and
in Wyre Forest, Worcestershire. The latter, however, is the
only Service tree that could put in such a claim, for it grows&mdash;or grew?&mdash;far
from habitations or cultivated land, and the
presumption is that it has not owed its introduction to man.
Still, "one swallow does not make a summer," and a solitary
wild tree does not give the species a title to be reckoned as
British. It is occasionally cultivated here, and its portrait,
with a brief account of its points of difference from the
Mountain Ash, may be useful. A comparison of the photographs
from the boles of the two species will show a great
difference: that of the Mountain Ash being smooth, whilst
that of the Service is rugged. The leaf is similarly broken
up into paired leaflets, but these are broader, and are downy
on both upper and lower sides. The white flowers are as
large as May-blossoms, and the fruits, which may be either
apple-shaped or pear-shaped, are greenish-brown, with rusty
specks, and four times the size of Rowan-berries. In winter,
when there are neither leaves, flowers, nor fruits to help in
the distinction, the bark may be taken in conjunction with
the leaf-buds, which are green and smooth in this species,
whilst those of the Mountain Ash are black and downy. The
fruit may be eaten after it has begun to decay, as in the case
of the Medlar.</p>

<p>Loudon describes the wood of the Service as the hardest
and heaviest of all the trees indigenous to Europe: fine-grained,
red-tinted, susceptible of a high polish, and much<!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
in request in France for all purposes where strength and
durability are needed. He further says that it takes two
centuries to attain its full stature (fifty to sixty feet), "and lives
to so great an age that some specimens of it are believed
to be upwards of 1000 years old."</p>

<p>We have already made reference to the meaning of the
name Service. Another name&mdash;Sorb (from Latin <i>sorbeo</i>)&mdash;shows
closer affinity for the fermented liquor indicated by
Servise, for it means "drink down." A third name is Chequer-tree,
which Dr. Prior tells us is an antique pronunciation of
the word <i>choker</i>, in allusion to the unpalatable fruit, fit to
choke one. Choke-pear, it will be remembered, is a synonym
of the Wild Pear. Britten and Holland regard the name
Chequer-tree as having no connection with choking, but an
indication of the chequered or spotted appearance of the fruit.</p>

</div>

<p>The Medlar (<i>Pyrus germanica</i>) is a small tree, native of
Persia, Asia Minor, and Greece, and which is generally held to
occur wild in England and the Channel Islands only as an
escape from cultivation. The theory is that the tree was
introduced at some date prior to 1596&mdash;when we have record of
its being in cultivation here&mdash;and that the Medlar-trees growing
in the hedges of south and middle England are from seeds of
these cultivated trees, which have been sown by birds, or more
probably mammals who have eaten the fruit. The fact that it
is not found in woods is taken as evidence that it is non-indigenous.
Such evidence is not the most convincing, but it
is the best available. It should be noted, however, that the
agents credited with its distribution along our hedgerows have
free access to woods, and that if these places were favourable
to the growth of the Medlar, we should probably find it there,
whether indigenous or exotic. Much more conclusive, we think,
is its restricted distribution abroad, as already indicated. One
would not expect to find a tree whose nearest home is Greece,<!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
leaping over the whole of Europe and appearing as an indigene
in Britain.</p>

<p>In its wild condition the Medlar is a much-branched and
spiny tree, from ten to twenty feet high, in these respects
resembling the Hawthorn; but, like the Pear, it puts off its
defences when cultivated. Its leaves are large and undivided,
of an oblong-lance shape, downy beneath, and sometimes with
the edges very finely toothed. The solitary white flowers are
large&mdash;one and a half inches across&mdash;with a woolly calyx, whose
five tips expand into leafy growths. They appear in May or<!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
June, and are succeeded by brown fruits, an inch or less across,
which may be described as round, with a depressed top, which
is ornamented with the remains of the calyx-lobes. They ripen
in October or November.</p>


<h3>Hawthorn (<i>Crat&aelig;gus oxyacantha</i>).</h3>

<p>Though distributed as a wild tree throughout the length and
breadth of the British Islands, we are all more familiar with the
Hawthorn as planted material in the construction of hedges,
and this is a use to which it has been put ever since land
was plotted out and enclosed. For the word is Anglo-Saxon
(<i>h&aelig;gthorn</i>), and signifies hedge-thorn. The man in the street
would say without hesitation that Hawthorn means the thorn
that produces Haws, but the philologist would tell him that it
is only a modern and erroneous practice to apply the name of
the hedge to the fruit of the hedge-thorn. It is also Whitethorn,
to make the distinction between its light-grey bark and that of
the Blackthorn; and May because of the period when it chiefly
attracts attention.</p>

<span class="caption">Hawthorn, or May.
<br />
A, fruit (&quot;haws&quot;).</span>
</div>

<p>Where the Hawthorn is allowed its natural growth, it
attains a height of forty feet, with a circumference between
three and ten feet. Such a tree is represented in our photograph.
On our commons, where in their youth the Hawthorns
have to submit to much mutilation from browsing animals,
their growth is spoiled; but though some of these never
become more than bushes tangled up with Blackthorn into
small thickets, there are others that form a distinct bole
and a round head of branches from ten to twenty feet high,
which in late May or (more frequently) early June look like
solid masses of snow. The characteristic of the tree which
makes it so valuable as fencing material is found in its
numerous branches, supporting a network of twigs so dense
that even a hand may not be pushed among them without<!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
incurring serious scratches. That this character is not confined
to it as a hedge shrub is clearly shown by the winter
photograph of the leafless tree.</p>

<p>The well-known lobed leaves are very variable both in size
and shape, and the degree to which they are cut. They
are a favourite food with horses and oxen, who would demolish
the hedges that confine them to the fields but for
the spines which protect the older branches at least. The
white flowers are about three-quarters of an inch across,
borne in numerous corymbs. The pink anthers give relief
to the uniform whiteness of the petals. The flowers, though<!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
usually sweet-scented, occasionally give forth a very unpleasant
odour. The familiar fruits, too, instead of their usual crimson,
are yellow occasionally, as in the Holly. In favourable years
these are so plentiful that they quite kill the effect of the
dark-green leaves, and when such a tree is seen in the
October sunshine, it appears to be glowing with fire to its
centre. Beneath the ripe mealy flesh there is a hard bony
core, in whose cells the seeds are protected from digestion
when the fruit has been swallowed by a bird.</p>

<p>The Hawthorn is said to live from a century to two centuries,
growing very slowly after it has reached a height of
about fifteen feet. Its wood is both hard and tough, and
the name of the genus has reference to that fact, being
derived from the Greek <i>kratos</i>, strength.</p>

<h3>The Strawberry-tree (<i>Arbutus unedo</i>).</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 389px;">
<a href="images/i_241.jpg"><img src="images/i_241_tn.jpg" width="389" height="400" alt="Strawberry-tree." title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Strawberry-tree.</span>
</div>

<p>Not in the woods or by waysides in Great Britain will the
Strawberry-tree be found, though it may be seen in parks
and gardens; but in parts of the Emerald Isle it is native.
Killarney, Muckross, and Bantry are given by Hooker as its
Irish stations, but we have also found it in the woods at
Woodstock, Co. Kilkenny, in a situation where it seemed
unlikely such a tree would be planted. It does not attain a
large size&mdash;ordinarily about ten or twelve feet&mdash;though in
cultivation it may attain to twenty or even thirty feet. The
bark is rough and scaly, tinged with red, and twisted. The
leathery leaves are more or less oval, two or three inches
long, with toothed edges and hairy stalks. Although arranged
alternately on the shoots, they present the appearance at a
little distance of being clustered, rosette fashion, at the tips
of the twigs. The creamy-white flowers are clustered in
drooping racemes at the ends of the twigs, and are about
one-third of an inch across, bell-shaped. When the seed-eggs<!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
have been fertilized the corollas drop off, so that in the
flowering season (September and October) the ground beneath
will usually be found strewn with them. The fruit is a round
berry, of an orange-red hue, whose surface is completely
studded with little points. As these berries do not come to
maturity until about fourteen months after the flowers have
dropped their corollas, we may see both flowers and almost
full-formed fruit on the tree at the same time. They are<!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
not eatable until quite ripe, and even then they are not to
everybody's taste, on account of their austerity. In truth,
we have it on the testimony of Pliny that the old Latin
name <i>unedo</i>, now enshrined in the specific scientific name, was
given to it because to eat one of these tree strawberries
was a sufficiently extensive acquaintance for most persons.</p>

<p>It is perhaps unnecessary to add that, in spite of the
name, there is no relationship existing between this tree and
<i>the</i> Strawberry; nor is there more than a faint superficial
resemblance between the fruits of the two plants. The
Strawberry belongs to the great Rose family, whilst the nearest
British connections of the Arbutus are the Bilberries and
Heaths.</p>

<h3>Dogwood (<i>Cornus sanguinea</i>).</h3>

<p>Among the constituents of the broad hedgerow, and the
copse that borders many a country road, the Dogwood or Cornel
is apt to be overlooked as Privet, to which its similar, opposite
leaves and clusters of small white flowers bear a superficial
resemblance. It has a great variety of local names, though
it must be admitted that many of these show close connections
one with another. This, however, makes them not less interesting,
but indicates how ancient and general is the underlying
idea which has given rise to them. Dogwood had originally no
connection with dogs, but was the wood of which dags, goads,
and skewers were made, because, as the Latin <i>Cornus</i> signifies,
it was of horny hardness and toughness. When the etymology
got changed by the substitution of "o" for "a" in dag, it was
also called Dog-tree, Dog-berry, Dog-timber, and Houndberry-tree,
and to explain the name it was said that the bark made an
excellent wash for mangy dogs. Gatter, Gatten, Gaiter, Gaitre-berry,
are all from the Anglo-Saxon <i>Gad-treow</i>, or goad-tree;<!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Gadrise means Goad-shrub (<i>Gad-riis</i>), and Gatteridge is <i>gaitre
rouge</i>, from the red colour of the bare twigs.</p>

<span class="caption">Dogwood, or Cornel.
<br />
A, flowers; B, berries.</span>
</div>

<p>But we must not overlook the shrub itself whilst considering
its wealth of names. It grows to a height of six or eight feet,
and is clothed with opposite oval leaves, which are smooth on
both surfaces. The honeyed flowers are produced in June or
July at the extremities of the branches in dense round cymes.
Individually they are small (one-third of an inch across), opaque
white, with four petals and four stamens, which mature concurrently
with the stigma. They give out an unpleasant
odour, which appears to render them more attractive to flies and<!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
small beetles. The flowers are succeeded by small green berries,
which turn purple-black about September, and are exceedingly
bitter. They are said to yield an oil which is used in France
for soap-making, and has been here burned in lamps.</p>

<p>The Dogwood is widely distributed over Britain as far north
as Westmoreland. It does not occur in Scotland, and is rare
in Ireland. It would seem as though its place in North Britain
was taken by a herbaceous species, the Dwarf Cornel (<i>Cornus
suecica</i>), which grows upon Alpine moorlands from Yorkshire
as far north as Sutherlandshire. The stems of this, which have
as many inches to their stature as the shrub has feet, die down
annually. Its minute flowers are purplish instead of white, and
its smaller berries red.</p>

<h3>Wayfaring-tree (<i>Viburnum lantana</i>).</h3>

<p>The Wayfaring-tree has a number of names by which it is
known locally, but the one we have used is generally known,
though it may have the disadvantage of being a comparatively
modern one whose parentage is known to us. The origin of
most of these popular names is lost in the mists of antiquity.
John Gerarde, whose "Herbal" was published in 1597, noting
its fondness for roadside hedges and thickets, called it Wayfaring-tree,
or Wayfaringman's-tree. Thereupon Parkinson,
nearly half a century later, remarks: "Gerard calleth it in
English the Wayfaring tree, but I know no travailer doth take
either pleasure or profit by it more than by any other hedge
trees." Our own experience serves to prove that Wayfarers, as
a class, have improved since Parkinson's day, for we have
frequently been questioned in the Surrey chalk-districts, at
various seasons, respecting the bold plant; in winter showing
its large naked buds, all rough with starry hairs, which keep
off frost, as well as do the many scales and thick varnish of
Horse-chestnut buds; in summer the broad, hairy leaves, looking<!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
as dusty as a miller's coat, whilst above them spread the slightly
rounded heads of white flowers; later, when the flowers are
succeeded by bunches of glowing coral beads, that in autumn
become beads of jet. It is not confined to the chalk-hills, but
as far north as Yorkshire may be looked for wherever the soil is
dry, though it finds this condition best on the chalk, and is
there especially abundant. It is not indigenous in either Scotland
or Ireland.</p>

<span class="caption">Wayfaring-tree.
<br />
A, portion of flower-cluster.</span>
</div>

<p>Though it grows to a height of twenty feet in places, it can
never properly be called a tree. Its downy stems are never
very stout. They branch a good deal, and it should be noted
that the branches are always given off in pairs, a branch from<!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
each side of the stem at exactly the same height; the leaves are
produced in the same order. These leaves, which are three or
four inches in length, are much wrinkled, heart-shaped, with a
blunt, small end, white beneath, and the edges very finely toothed.
The flower-cluster is a cyme, and it should be noted that all the
white flowers comprised in it are of the same size and form, the
corollas being funnel-shaped, with five lobes, and the five stamens
are extruded from the mouth. The flowers, which are jointed
to the stalks, are out in May and June, and the flattened oval
fruits that follow are, as already stated, at first red, then black.</p>

<p>The local names for this shrub include Mealy-tree, Whipcrop,
Cotton-tree, Cottoner, Coventree, Lithe-wort, Lithy-tree, Twist-wood,
White-wood. Mealy-tree, Cotton-tree, Cottoner, and
White-wood all have obvious reference to the appearance of the
young shoots and leaves, due to the presence of the white hairs
with which they are covered. Lithe-wort and Lithy-tree, also
Twist-wood and Whipcrop, indicate the supple and elastic
character of the branches, which are often used instead of Withy
to bind up a bundle of sticks or vegetables, or to make a hoop
for a gate-fastener. In Germany the shoots, when only a year
old, are used in basket-weaving, and, when a year or two older,
serve for pipe-stems.</p>

</div>

<p>Although the Guelder Rose and the Wayfaring-tree are very
closely related, the differences between them are so great that
there is little danger of any person with ordinary powers of
observation confusing them. The Guelder Rose does not grow
so tall as its congener, twelve feet being about the extreme
height to which it attains in a wild state, and ordinarily it is
several feet less. It is not so fond of dry soils, and is more
frequently found in the copse, where it is not subject to the<!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
extremes of heat and cold that have produced the hairy covering
of <i>V. lantana</i>. The stems and branches are quite smooth,
and the leaf-buds are wrapped in scales. The young leaves,
it is true, when they break from the bud, are covered with
down, but they throw this off as they expand to their full
size, and become smooth on either side. Instead of the leaf
being heart-shaped, it is divided into three deeply toothed
lobes, and it will be noted that at the base of the leaf-stalk
there is a pair of slender stipules, which <i>lantana</i> never has.<!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
The cyme or flower-head is more rounded, and whilst the
mass of flowers are of the same size (a quarter of an inch)
as those of the Wayfaring-tree, those in the outer row are
three times the size&mdash;but they are entirely without stamens
or pistil! It would appear that in order to make the flower-cluster
more conspicuous, and thus attract insects, the material
that should have gone to furnish these organs has been used up
in the broader and whiter corolla. The inner and perfect flowers
are creamy-white, bell-shaped, and they secrete honey. Both
stamens and stigma mature simultaneously. The fruits are
almost round, and of a clear, translucent red. Respecting these
fruits, we cannot forbear from quoting a remark of Hamerton's.
He says, writing as the French recorder of the <i>Sylvan Year</i>:
"For any one who enjoys the sight of red berries in the most
jewel-like splendour, there is nothing in winter like the Viburnum,
the species we call <i>Viorne obier</i>, and if you meet with a fine
specimen just when it is caught by the level rays of a crimson
sunset, you will behold a shrub that seems to have come from
that garden of Aladdin where the fruit of the trees were jewels."
These fruits, though enticing to the sight, and juicy, are nauseous
to the taste.</p>

<p>The name Guelder Rose is a strange case of transference
from a cultivated to a wild plant: the var. <i>sterilis</i>, in which <i>all</i>
the flowers are like the outer row in the normal cluster, was first
cultivated in Gelderland; so Gerarde tells us that "it is called
in Dutch, <i>Gheldersche Roose</i>; in English, <i>Gelder's Rose</i>." In
the Cotswolds it is known as King's Crown, from the "King of
the May" having been crowned with a chaplet of it. Another
name for it is Water Elder, presumably given on account of
the similar appearance of the flower-clusters in <i>Viburnum</i> and
<i>Sambucus</i>.</p>

<p>The distribution of the Guelder Rose as a wild plant extends
northwards to Caithness, although it is rare in Scotland. It
occurs throughout Ireland.</p>

<p>The Elder is more a tree of the wayside than of the woodland,
often of low bushy growth; but where it finds good loamy soil
with abundant moisture it attains a height of twenty feet. None
of our trees grows more rapidly in its earliest years, and any bit
of its living wood will readily take root, so that its presence in
the hedge is often due to planting for the purpose of rapidly
erecting a live screen. Its quickly grown juicy shoots soon
harden into a tube of tough wood with a core of pith which is<!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
readily extracted, and renders the tube available for a peashooter,
a pop-gun, or a music-pipe. Such uses have been
known from remote antiquity&mdash;probably one might say from the
beginnings of the human race. The ancient Greeks called it
<i>Sambúke</i>, from its wood having been used in the making of
musical instruments. In the north of Britain it is known as
Bourtree, Bore-tree, or Bottery, from the ease with which this
clearing out of the pith is effected, and it is pretty clear that the
more general name of Elder also has relation to the tubular
shoots. Piers Plowman calls the tree Eller, a name that survives
in Kent, Sussex, Lincoln, East Yorks, and Cheshire. This word,
according to Prior, is derived from the Anglo-Saxon <i>eller</i> and
<i>ellarn</i>, and seems to mean "kindler"&mdash;"a name which we may
suppose that it acquired from its hollow branches being used,
like the bamboo in the tropics, to blow up a fire." It is thus
probable that the housewife got her bellows, the musician his
pipe, and the schoolboy his pop-gun, all from the same source.</p>

<p>The stems are coated with a grey corky bark, and the
younger divisions of the branches show an angular section when
cut. When old, the wood becomes hard and heavy, and has
been used as a substitute for Box. The leaf is divided into five,
seven, or nine oval leaflets with toothed edges. The flower is of
the form that botanists describe as <i>rotate</i>, that is, the corolla
forms a very short tube, from the mouth of which five petal-like
lobes spread flat. This is a quarter of an inch broad, and
creamy-white in colour, giving out an odour which some persons
like, but which the writer considers offensive. Large numbers
of these small flowers are gathered into flat-topped cymes, five
or six inches in diameter. The primary stalks of these cymes
are five in number. The flowers are succeeded by small globular
berries, ultimately of a purple-black hue, and of mawkish flavour,
which are yet much sought after by country people for the making
of Elderberry wine, which they credit with marvellous medicinal
powers. In truth, the Elder still retains among rustic folk much<!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
of the reputation it had when John Evelyn praised it so highly
in his "Sylva," where he says, "If the medicinal properties of
the leaves, bark, berries, etc., were thoroughly known, I cannot
tell what our countryman could ail for which he might not fetch
a remedy from every hedge, either for sickness or wound."</p>

<p>Occasionally one may find in the hedgerow an Elder with its
leaflets deeply cut into very slender lobes, so that the leaf has
resemblance to that of Fool's Parsley. This is an escape from
cultivation&mdash;a garden variety (<i>laciniata</i>) known as the Cut-leaved
or Parsley-leaved Elder.</p>

<h3>The Box (<i>Buxus sempervirens</i>).</h3>

<p>Though frequently to be met with in parks and ornamental
grounds, there are only a few places in this country where the
Box is really indigenous. These are in the counties of Surrey,
Kent, Buckingham, and Gloucester. On the famous Box Hill,
near Dorking, in Surrey, it may be seen attaining its proper
proportions as a small tree, and in sufficient abundance to form
groves covering a considerable area. It grows to a height of
fifteen or twenty feet, with a girth of about twenty inches. Its
slender branches are clothed with small, oblong, leathery leaves,
which give out a peculiar and distinctive odour. They are about
an inch in length, polished on the upper side, evergreen, and
opposite.</p>

A, male flowers; B, female flower.</span>
</div>

<p>The flowers may be looked for from January to May, and
will be found clustered between the leaf and the stem. These
are quite small and inconspicuous, of a whitish-green colour,
and the sexes are in separate flowers. The uppermost one in
the centre of each cluster is a female flower; the others are
males. The males consist of four petals, enclosing a rudimentary
ovary, from beneath which spring four stamens. The
sepals of the female flower vary in number, from four to twelve,
and enclose a rounded ovary with three styles, which are ripe<!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
and protruded before the males open. This develops into the
three-celled capsule with three diverging beaks, which correspond
with the styles, and in each cell there are one or two black
seeds.</p>

<p>The growth of the tree is very slow, and, in consequence, the
grain of its wood is very fine. It is also very hard, and so
heavy that alone among native woods it will not float in water.
On account of its fine grain and hardness, it is in request by the
turner and mathematical instrument maker, and was formerly
largely used by the wood-engraver for "woodcuts." Since the<!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
introduction of the photographic "process" blocks, the industry
of preparing Box-wood for the engraver must have become all
but extinct, and for that reason Box plantations must be less
valuable assets than formerly. It is on record that when the
Box Hill trees were cut in 1815, the "fall" realized nearly
£10,000. Box Hill is in no sense a plantation; its slopes and
summit are clothed with a natural mixed wood of Box, Oak,
Beech, and Yew. Beneath every Box-tree will be found
hundreds of seedlings of various ages. Some of these may be
seen in our photograph, which depicts naturally grown Box-trees
on the famous hill. It will be noted that their "habit" is
widely different from that of the more bush-like forms so
familiar in gardens.<!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

EXOTIC TREES AND SHRUBS.</h2>


<p>We have already given descriptions and illustrations of several
exotic species in <a href="#PART_I">Part I</a>., where it seemed more advantageous
to the reader to include them with British species of the same
genus; those now to be dealt with are in all cases members of
genera not represented in our native Flora.</p>


<h3>The Plane (<i>Platanus orientalis</i>).</h3>

<p>In spite of the fact that the Plane is an exotic of comparatively
recent introduction, it seems in a fair way of being associated
in the future with London. It has taken with great
kindness to London life, in spite of the drawbacks of smoke,
fog, flagstones, and asphalt. Its leaves get thickly coated with
soot, which also turns its light-grey bark to black; but as the
upper surface of the leaves is smooth and firm, a shower of rain
washes them clean, and the rigid outer layer of bark is thrown
off by the expansion of the softer bark beneath. This is not
thrown off all at once, but in large and small flakes, which leave
a smooth yellow patch behind, temporarily free from soot contamination.
A variety of trees has been tried for street-planting,
but none has stood the trying conditions of London so well as<!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the Plane, and therefore before many years the capital will be
the city of Planes.</p>

<span class="caption">Oriental Plane.</span>
</div>

<p>Two species are recognized&mdash;the Oriental Plane (<i>Platanus
orientalis</i>) and the Western Plane (<i>P. occidentalis</i>); but it
would probably be more accurate to regard them as geographical
varieties of one species, the points in which they differ being
small and not very important. Thus the leaves of the Oriental
Plane are described as being so much more deeply lobed than
those of the Western Plane that the former are botanically
described as palmate; but the two forms of leaf may often be
found on the same individual. The Western Plane, too, does<!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
not shed its bark in small flakes like the Oriental Plane, but in
large sheets.</p>

<p>Planes normally rise to a height of something between seventy
and ninety feet, and the trunk attains a circumference of from
nine to twelve feet; but there is a record of a portly Plane whose
waist measurement was forty feet! Many persons imagine
because the leaves of the Plane resemble those of the Sycamore
that the two are closely related; but this is not so, and
a comparison of the flowers and fruit will show that they
are not. The catkins of the Plane take the form of balls,
in which male <i>or</i> female flowers are pressed together; and
the fruits, instead of being winged samaras, are the rough
balls that so closely resemble an old-fashioned form of button,
that the tree is known in some parts of the United States as
the Button-wood. (It is also known there as Sycamore and
Cotton-tree.)</p>

<p>The Plane is supposed to have got its name <i>Platanus</i> from
the Greek word <i>platus</i> (broad), in double allusion to the broad
leaves and the ample shadow which the tree throws. These
leaves are five-lobed, and, as already indicated, those of the
Oriental species are much more deeply cut. Further distinction
is found in the colour of the petiole or leaf-stalk, which is green
in <i>P. orientalis</i>, and purplish-red in <i>P. occidentalis</i>, and in the
larger and smoother seed-buttons of the latter. Instead of the
leaves being attached to the stem in pairs, as we saw in
the Sycamore, those of the Plane are alternate&mdash;that is to say,
leaf number two of a series will be halfway between one and
three, but on the opposite side of the shoot.</p>

<p>The outline of the tree is not so regular as in most others,
the leaves being gathered in heavy masses, with broad spaces
between, rather than equally distributed over the head. This
is, of course, due to the freedom with which the crooked arms
are flung about. The pale-brown wood is fine-grained, tough,
and hard, and is extensively used by pianoforte-makers, coach-<!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>builders,
and cabinet-makers, but is not highly esteemed for
other purposes to which timber is put in this country.</p>

<p>The Oriental Plane is popularly supposed to have been introduced
to England from the Levant by Francis Bacon, but if
Loudon's statement that it was "in British gardens before
1548" rests on good evidence, Bacon's claim is dismissed, for
<i>he</i> was not "introduced" until 1561. It was nearly a hundred
years later (1640) that the Occidental Plane was first brought
from Virginia by the younger Tradescant, and planted in that
remarkable garden of his father's in South Lambeth Road.
The form that has done so well in London, and of which many
fine examples are to be seen in the parks and squares, is a
variety of the Oriental Plane, with leaves less deeply divided
than those of the type, and therefore more nearly approaching
the Occidental Plane in this respect. It is distinguished by
the name of the Maple-leaved Plane (<i>Platanus orientalis</i>, var.
<i>acerifolia</i>). It is this variety we have chosen as the subject for
our photograph.</p>

<h3>The Walnut (<i>Juglans regia</i>).</h3>

<p>In the Golden Age, when man lived happily on a handful of
acorns, the gods fed upon walnuts, and so their name was <i>Jovis
glans</i>&mdash;the nuts of Jupiter&mdash;since contracted into <i>Juglans</i>.
Those who delight in obvious interpretations by appealing to
the modern meanings of words similar in construction may be
pardoned for supposing that Walnut-trees were formerly trained
against walls; but, like many other obvious interpretations, this
is wide of the mark. Some have gone back to the Anglo-Saxons
for help, and though the result arrived at is in all probability
the correct one, it is almost certain that the Anglo-Saxons knew
nothing of the matter, and would scarcely trouble to give a
name to something they had never seen. The Walnut is a
native of the Himalayas, the Hindu Kuh, Persia, Lebanon, and<!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Asia Minor to Greece. The learned Roman, Varro, who was
born <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 116, and died <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 28, mentions it as existing in Italy
in his day; and Pliny tells us it was brought thence from Persia.
The date of its introduction to Britain is usually set down as
about the middle of the sixteenth century, but it was probably
at least a century earlier, for Gerarde, writing at the close of
the sixteenth century, describes it as a tree commonly to be seen
in orchards, and in fields near the highways, where a very new
importation was not likely to be found. But to return to the
name: there can be little doubt that it is a contraction of
Wälsh-nut (in modern spelling, Welsh-nut), meaning foreign.
This is German, and while the modern sons of the Vaterland
write it Wallnuss (occasionally Wälshenuss), the Dutch form
is Wallnoot. That this is the true derivation is made pretty
certain by Gerarde, who calls it "Walnut, and of some Walsh-nut."</p>

<p>That the new importation was fully appreciated in Europe
for its fruit may be judged by the extent to which its cultivation
had spread in Evelyn's day, for he tells us the trees abounded in
Burgundy, where they stood in the midst of goodly wheat-lands.
He says: "In several places betwixt Hanau and Frankfort in
Germany no young farmer is permitted to marry a wife till he
bring proof that he hath planted and is a father of such a
stated number of [Walnut] trees, and the law is inviolably
observed to this day, for the extraordinary benefit the tree
affords the inhabitants."</p>

Walnut&mdash;summer.</span>
</div>

<p>The Walnut is a handsome tree, growing to a height of forty
to sixty feet, with a bole twenty feet or more in circumference,
and a huge spreading head. The bark is of a cool grey colour,
smooth when young, but as the tree matures deep longitudinal
furrows form, and it becomes very rugged. The twisted
branches take a direction more upward than horizontal, but
in early summer they are almost completely hidden by the
masses of large and handsome leaves of warm green colour and<!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
spicy aroma. I once rejoiced in the occupation of a garden
that held two Walnut-trees, and though they had not attained
to the fruiting age, their possession was a delight to me; but
then I am one of those who enjoy their fragrance, which is unbearable
to some persons. The large leaves are formed after the
fashion of the Ash-leaf&mdash;broken up into a variable number of
lance-shaped leaflets with scarcely perceptible teeth.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">Walnut.
<br />
A, female flowers; B, male flowers.</span>
</div>

<p>The flowering of the Walnut is much on the plan of the Oak
and the Hazel, the sexes being in different flowers, but borne by<!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
one tree; the males forming a long drooping catkin of slender
cylindrical form, the females being solitary, or a few grouped
at the end of a shoot. Separated from the catkin, the males
will each be seen to consist of a calyx of five greenish scales,
enclosing a large number of stamens. The calyx of the female
closely invests the ovary, which has two or three fleshy stigmas.
The flowering takes place in early spring, before the leaf-buds
have burst. The fruit is a plum-like drupe, only the enveloping
green flesh becomes brown, and, splitting irregularly, discloses
the "stone," which in this species takes the form of a hard but
thin-shelled nut&mdash;the well-known Walnut, with its wrinkled kernel
of crisp white flesh, from which a fine oil is obtained. The
ripening of these nuts&mdash;which is accomplished by the beginning
of October&mdash;can only be relied upon in the southern half of
Britain, and even there the crop is often spoiled by late
frosts in spring. Its chief value in Europe is as a fruit-tree,
though the light but tough wood is much esteemed for the
manufacture of furniture. Owing to its rapid growth, the grain
is coarse, but the dark-brown colour is esteemed, especially as
it is relieved by streaks and veins of lighter tints and black.
It is easily worked, and bears a high polish. The wood of
young trees is white, gradually deepening to brown as maturity is
approached. All the juices of the tree, whether from wood, bark,
leaves, or green fruit, are rich in the brown pigment to which
the hue of the timber is due. The combined lightness and
toughness of the wood led to its adoption as the favourite material
for making the stocks of guns and rifles. It is said that so
great was the demand for this purpose during the Peninsular
War, that a single Walnut-tree realized £600 for its timber, and
this created a boom that led to the cutting down of all our finest
Walnut-trees. Some of these were doubtless the very trees
referred to by Evelyn, who tells us the Walnut was extensively
planted at Leatherhead in Surrey, also at Cassaulton (Carshalton)
and Godstone in the same county, where the rambler may<!-- Page 135 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
come across fine Walnut-trees to this day, and occasionally to
young ones growing wild in hedgerows and wastes.</p>

<p>The old doggerel adage, "A dog and a wife and a walnut-tree,
the more they are beaten the better they be," has reference
to the manner of harvesting the ripe fruit. Evelyn says: "In
Italy they arm the tops of long poles with nails and iron for the
purpose [of loosening the fruit], and believe the beating improves
the tree; which I no more believe than I do that discipline would
reform a shrew." He expresses no opinion on the question of
beating dogs.</p>


<h3>Sweet Chestnut (<i>Castanea sativa</i>).</h3>

<p>Until about the middle of the last century the Chestnut was
generally regarded as a genuine native of these islands. It is
true that botanists felt that so large and longevous a tree, if
native, should be found in the natural forests of this country, or
even forming pure forest. These things they did not find, but,
on the other hand, they were shown beams in ancient buildings,
including Westminster Abbey, which were believed to be Chestnut-wood,
and this evidence seemed to point to the fact that
Chestnut timber was grown much more plentifully in this country
at the period when these old buildings were erected. Dr.
Lindley, however, set the matter at rest by examination of the
reputed Chestnut beams in the roof of Westminster Abbey,
and proved that they were of Durmast Oak. A similar examination
of the timbers of the old Louvre in Paris, which were also
reputed to be Chestnut, gave a similar result. A comparison
of sections across the grain of Oak and Chestnut allows of no
possibility of mistake, and it is now known that whilst the wood
of young Chestnuts is tough and durable, that from old trees is
brittle and comparatively worthless, except for firewood, which
is exactly the opposite of Oak-wood. It is now generally agreed
that its real home is in Asia Minor and Greece, whence it was<!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
introduced to Italy in very remote times, and has since spread
over most of temperate Europe, its seeds ripening and sowing
themselves wherever the vine flourishes. We appear to be
indebted to our friends the Romans for its introduction to
Britain, who no doubt hoped to utilize the fruit for food, as at
home&mdash;a hope that must have been disappointed, for its crops,
even in the South of England, are very fitful, and the nuts quite
small.</p>

<p>In suitable situations the Chestnut is of larger proportions
and greater length of life even than the Oak. In the South of
England it will attain a height of from sixty to eighty feet in
fifty or sixty years, and if growing in deep porous loam, free
from carbonate of lime, and sheltered from strong winds and
frosts, it builds up an erect massive column. Hamerton has
said of such a tree: "His expression is that of sturdy strength;
his trunk and limbs are built, not like those of Apollo, but like
the trunk and limbs of Hercules." Under less suitable conditions
the undivided trunk is little more than ten feet long;
then it divides off into several huge limbs, and so the general
character of the tree is altered, and it presents much the
appearance of having been pollarded. The branches have a
horizontal and downward habit of growth, the extremities of
the lowest ones often being but little above the earth. The fine
elliptical leaves are nine or ten inches in length, of a rich green,
that is enhanced by the polished surface, which "brings up" the
colour. Their edges are cut into long pointed teeth. Towards
autumn they pale to light yellow, and then deepen into gold on
their way to the final brown of the fallen leaf, which, by the
way, is a great enricher of the soil where the Chestnut is
grown.</p>

<span class="caption">Sweet Chestnut.
<br />
A, fruit.</span>
</div>

<p>The flowers, though individually small and inconspicuous, are
rather striking, from their association in cylindrical yellow catkins,
about six inches long, which hang from the axils of the leaves.
The upper part of this catkin consists of male flowers, each with<!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
a number of stamens enclosed in a perianth or calyx of five or six
green leaves. The female flowers, on the lower part of the catkin,
are two or three together, in a prickly four-lobed "cupule," or
involucre, and consist each of a calyx closely investing a tapering
ovary, whose summit bears from five to eight radiating
stigmas, the number corresponding with the cells into which the
ovary is divided. Each cell contains two seed-eggs, but as a
rule only one in each flower develops. As development of the
ovary and seeds progresses, the cupule also grows, and ultimately
entirely surrounds the cluster with the hedgehog-like coat
in which the nuts are contained when ripe. Then it splits open<!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
and discloses the two or three glossy brown nuts. The Chestnut
is in flower from May to July, and the nuts drop in October.
They form an important article of food in South Europe, where
they are produced in abundance, and there can be little doubt
that the importers of the tree to this country believed it would
prove equally valuable here. Evelyn had this in mind when he
recommended the nut as "a lusty and masculine food for rustics
at all times, and of better nourishment for husbandmen than
cole and rusty bacon." Well, there is plenty of Chestnut grown
around Evelyn's estate at Wootton to-day, but it is chiefly as
coppice, to provide hop-poles, and hoops for barrels, for which
purpose the long straight shoots are split in two. Grown as
coppice, the Chestnut also provides fine cover for pheasants and
other game. The trees begin to bear when about twenty-five
years old, and from thence on to the fiftieth or sixtieth year the
timber is at its best, but later it develops the defect known as
"ring shake," and becomes of little use. That is probably why
one meets with so many hollow wrecks of what were once noble
Chestnuts.</p>

<p>The young wood is covered with smooth brown bark, but later
this becomes grey, and its surface splits into longitudinal fissures,
which give a very distinctive character to the trunk. In older
trees the fissures and the alternating ridges have a slight spiral
twist, which gives the tree the appearance (shown in our third
photo) of having been wrenched round by some mighty force.
The average age of the Chestnut is about five hundred years,
but there have been in this country many old trees that were
much older, if any reliance could be placed in local tradition.
There was&mdash;we fear there is little of it still remaining&mdash;the great
Tortworth Chestnut in Lord Ducies' park at Tortworth Court.
In 1820 it was found to have a girth of fifty-two feet. Evelyn
refers to it in his "Sylva," and tells us that in the reign of
King Stephen it already bore the title of the Great Chestnut of
Tortworth.<!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>The name Chestnut appears to be a modification of the old
Latin name <i>Castanea</i>, through the French form <i>Chataigner</i>.
The Latin is said to be derived from Kastanum, a town in
Thessaly, but it is more likely that the presence of Chestnut-trees
gave a name to the town, as has happened so many times
in our own country with various trees, the Chestnut included.</p>


<h3>Horse Chestnut (<i>&AElig;sculus hippocastanum</i>).</h3>

<p>Our placing the Chestnut and the Horse Chestnut into
juxtaposition must not be understood as a recognition of any
relationship that may be implied in their names, but rather
the reverse&mdash;to accentuate the differences that exist between
them, and which have led botanists to separate them widely
in all systems of classification. Although the fruits are sufficiently
similar to have suggested the name Chestnut being
applied to this, with a qualifying prefix, they have been
produced by flowers of entirely different character. Evelyn
tells us that the word Horse was added because of its virtues
in "curing horses broken-winded and other cattle of coughs,"
a statement for which he was no doubt indebted to Parkinson
(1640), who says, "Horse Chestnuts are given in the East
Country, and so through all Turkie, unto Horses to cure
them of the cough, shortnesse of winde, and such other diseases;"
but seeing that, in this country at least, horses refuse
to touch them, there can be little doubt that the name was
given to indicate their inferiority to the Sweet Chestnut, and
by a process only too well known to the student of early
botanical literature, the name was afterwards held to be
proof of their medicinal value to horses.</p>

Sweet Chestnut&mdash;winter.</span>
</div>

<p>The Horse Chestnut is a native of the mountain regions
of Greece, Persia, and Northern India, and is believed to
have been introduced to Britain about 1550. It is not a tree<!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
that will be found in the woodlands, or even by the wayside,
except when it is behind a fence; yet it constantly greets
the rambler who has left the suburban gardens behind him,
and in the public parks&mdash;notably the magnificent avenue of
Bushey Park&mdash;where by contrast it exhibits itself as the
grandest of all flowering trees. Though the stout cylindrical
bole is short, its erect trunk towers to a height of eighty or a
hundred feet, supporting the massive pyramid, beautiful on
account of its fine foliage and handsome flowers alike. The
stout branches take an upward direction at first, then stretch
outward and curve downwards, though in winter, when relieved
of the weight of foliage, their extremities curl sharply upward,
and the great buds in spring are almost erect.</p>

<p>These brown buds, with their numerous wraps and liberal
coating of varnish, afford considerable interest to the suburban
dweller in early spring. He watches their gradual swelling,
and the polish that comes upon them through the daily melting
of their varnish under the influence of sunshine. Then the
outer scales fall flat, the upper parts show green and loose;
there is a perceptible lengthening of the shoot, which leaves a
space between those outer wraps and the folded leaves. Next
the leaflets separate and assume a horizontal position as they
expand. Then probably there comes a frost, and next morning
the leaflets are all hanging down, almost blackened, flaccid and
dejected-looking. A warm southerly rain, followed by sunshine,
reinvigorates them, and we see that the lengthening of the
shoot has actually brought the incipient flower-spike clear into
view. By about the second week in May the pyramid is clothed
with bold handsome foliage, against which the conical spikes of
white blossoms, tinged with crimson and dotted with yellow,
stand out conspicuously.</p>

<p>The leaves are almost circular, but broken up, finger-fashion,
into seven toothed leaflets of different sizes, which appear to
have started as ovals, but the necessity for not overcrowding<!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
their neighbours has necessitated the portion nearest the leaf-stalk
taking a wedge shape. The large size of these leaves&mdash;as
much as eighteen inches across&mdash;leads the non-botanical
to regard the leaflets as being full leaves. On emerging from
the bud the leaves are seen to be covered with down, but as
they expand this is thrown off.</p>

</div>

<p>The flowers consist of a bell-shaped calyx with five lobes,
supporting five separate petals, pure white in colour, but
splashed and dotted with crimson and yellow towards the
base of the upper ones, to indicate the way to the honey-glands.
There are seven curved stamens, and in their midst<!-- Page 142 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
a longer curved style proceeding from a roundish ovary with
three cells. In each cell there are two seed-eggs, but as a
rule only one egg in two of the cells develops into a "nut."
The ovary develops into a large fleshy bur, with short stout
spines, which splits into three valves when the dark-red
glossy seeds are ripe. In the Sweet Chestnut the brown skin
of the nut is the ovary, which had been overgrown by the
prickly involucre; here the spiny green shell is the ovary,
and the "nut" a seed. Though horses will not eat this
bitter fruit, cattle, deer, and sheep are fond of it. Pounded
in water, it becomes one of the numerous vegetable substitutes
for soap. Under the name of Konker, or Conqueror, it
affords a seasonal joy to the average boy, who first bombards
the tree with sticks and stones to dislodge the fruit,
and then threads the ruddy konkers on string and does
battle with a chum similarly equipped, the one whose string
is broken or pulled from his hand by the conflict of weapons
being the vanquished. In some parts the game is led off
by the recitation of the rhyme, "Oblionker! my fust konker."</p>

Horse Chestnut&mdash;winter.</span>
</div>

<p>The growth of the tree is very rapid, and consequently the
timber is soft and of no value where durability is required.
Still, its even grain and susceptibility to a high polish make
it useful for indoor wood, such as cabinet-making and flooring.
It is also used for making charcoal for the gunpowder mills.
Although Salvator Rosa and other landscape painters have
made such good use of the Sweet Chestnut pictorially, they
have utterly neglected the Horse Chestnut; and Hamerton
hints that the cause of this neglect is the artist's inability
to represent its large flowers and leaves by the landscape
painter's ordinary method of laying on masses of colour: this
requires drawing. The tree begins to produce fruit about its
twentieth year, and continues to do so nearly every year.
Its age is estimated as about two hundred years. The bark,
at first smooth, breaks into irregular scales and in old trees<!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
a twist may be developed, as illustrated by our photo of
the bole.</p>

<p>The generic name <i>&AElig;sculus</i> (from Latin <i>esca</i>, food) has no
real connection with the tree, the ancients having given it to
some species of Oak with edible acorns (<i>vide</i> Pliny), but by
some unknown means it has become transferred to a tree whose
fruit is far too bitter to be eaten by man.</p>

<p>The Red-flowered Horse Chestnut (<i>&AElig;sculus carnea</i>) is a
smaller and less vigorous tree. Its origin is unknown, but it is
believed to be a garden hybrid that made its appearance about
1820.</p>


<h3>The Bay Tree (<i>Laurus nobilis</i>).</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i_294.jpg"><img src="images/i_294_tn.jpg" width="400" height="341" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Bay.
<br />
A, flower; B, fruit.</span>
</div>

<p>The Bay is the true Laurel, of whose leaves and berries the
wreaths were made in ancient days for poets and conquerors.
Naturally it is more of a shrub than a tree, for though it often
attains a height of sixty feet, it persists in sending up so many
suckers that the tree-like character is lost. In cultivation, however,
it is often grown on a single stem, as well as formed by
cutting into arbours and arches. We call to mind a Cornish
village, where a garden enclosure in its square (or "plestor," as
Gilbert White would say) was surrounded by about a dozen
Bays so grown. Bays grow abundantly in the gardens of South
Cornwall, and we always connected their general cultivation with
the pilchard fishery. Certainly, these trees in the plestor were
very convenient in the autumn and winter, for the leaves are an
essential ingredient in the proper composition of that seductive
dish, marinated pilchards, to which they impart their peculiar
aromatic flavour.</p>

<p>The Bay is a native of Southern Europe, whence it was
introduced at some date prior to 1562. Prior says the name is
the old Roman <i>bacca</i> (a berry), altered "by the usual omission
of 'c' between the two vowels," this plant having become the<!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
<i>bacca par excellence</i>, because its berries were articles of
commerce.</p>

<p>The evergreen leaves are lance-shaped, without teeth, and
arranged alternately on the branchlets. Not all the trees
produce the berries, for the sexes are in distinct individuals,
and all the white or yellowish four-parted flowers on one tree
are stamen-bearing, whilst on another individual they all bear
ovaries and no stamens. The berries, at first green, ultimately
become of a dark purple hue. The flowers will be found in
April or May; the ripe berries in October. The Bay is grown
chiefly as a shrubbery ornament, and can only survive our
winters out-of-doors in the South of England.</p>

Laburnum.</span>
</div><p><!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>


<h3>Laburnum (<i>Laburnum vulgare</i>).</h3>

<p>Although the Laburnums of our parks and gardens have all
come from seed, and themselves produce an abundance of it, we
do not meet with wayside "escapes" as we might expect to do,
having regard to the habit of the tree and the fact that it is
comparatively indifferent respecting character of soil. Possibly
a remark of Loudon's may explain this. He says that rabbits
are exceedingly fond of the bark, and it may be that they
destroy any young trees that are unprotected by palings or
netting. The tree produces such a glorification of many an
ordinary suburban road, when its flowering time comes round,
that one would like to note its effect as a common object of the
hillside and the woodland, against a background furnished by
our more sober native trees.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i_298.jpg"><img src="images/i_298_tn.jpg" width="400" height="352" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Laburnum.
<br />
A, seed-pod.</span>
</div>

<p>The Laburnum is at home in the mountain forests of Central
and Southern Europe, but there is no record of its introduction
to Britain. We do know, however, that it has been with us
for more than three centuries, for Gerarde, in his "Herbal,"
published 1597, refers to it as growing in his garden. It belongs
to the great Pea and Bean family (<i>Leguminos&aelig;</i>), and is very
closely related to the Common Broom, whose solitary flowers
those of the Laburnum's drooping racemes nearly resemble.
Ordinarily it is only a low tree of about twenty feet in height,
but in favourable situations it may attain to thirty feet or more.
Some of the larger Laburnums, however, are of a distinct
species (<i>L. alpinus</i>).</p>

<p>The pale round branches are clothed with leaves that are
divided into three oval-lance-shaped leaflets, covered on the
underside with silvery down. Both leaves and golden flowers
appear simultaneously in May, but from the fact that the latter
are gathered into numerous long pendulous racemes, their blaze
of colour makes the leaves almost invisible. Tennyson's description
of its flowering&mdash;"Laburnum, dropping wells of fire"<!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>&mdash;is
fine, but we rather prefer Cowper's "rich in streaming gold,"
as embodying a more exact colour idea. The flowers are
succeeded by long downy legumes or pods, like those of the
bean and pea, containing many seeds, which are of a dangerously
violent emetic character when introduced to the human stomach.
The dark wood is of coarse grain; but, in spite of this, hard
and enduring, and taking a good polish. It is chiefly used by
musical instrument makers, turners, and cabinet-makers.</p>

<p>Laburnum is the old Latin name, which is thus rather fancifully
explained by Prior, "an adjective from <i>L. labor</i>, denoting<!-- Page 147 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
what belongs to the <i>hour of labour</i>, and which may allude to its
closing its leaflets together at night, and expanding them by
day." Common local names are Golden Chain, suggested by
the strings of flowers, and Bean-trefoile and Pea-tree, having
reference to the leaves and legumes respectively.</p>


<h3>The Locust Tree (<i>Robinia pseudacacia</i>).</h3>

<p>Although the Locust, or False Acacia, is little planted now,
it is only paying the penalty for having had its merits enormously
exaggerated; just as human reputations sometimes sink into
oblivion after a season of popularity achieved by the persistent
"booming" of influential friends. The friend in this case was
William Cobbett, who, on his return from the United States,
about 1820, preached salvation to the timber grower through
the planting of Robinia; "nothing in the timber way could be
so great a benefit as the general cultivation of this tree." So
great was the demand thus created that Cobbett himself started
a nursery for the propagation and supply of Robinias, and so
great is the virtue of a name that people refused the Locust-trees
that every nurseryman had in stock and wished to sell,
and would be content with nothing but Cobbett's Robinias,
which could not be produced fast enough for the demand!
They thought it was an entirely new introduction, though it
had been grown in this country as an ornamental tree for nearly
two centuries! Its wood is hard, strong, and durable, but liable
to crack, and of limited utility.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">False Acacia, or Locust Tree.
<br />
A, seed-pod.</span>
</div>

<p>The Locust was introduced to Europe from North America
early in the seventeenth century, and was then thought to be
identical with the African Acacia. Linn&aelig;us named the genus
in honour of Jean Robin, a French botanist, whose son, an
official at the Jardin des Plantes, was the first to cultivate the
tree in Europe.</p>

<p>It is a tree of light and graceful proportions, its branches<!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
being long and slender, and the long narrow leaves being broken
up into a large number of small oval leaflets, arranged <i>pinnately</i>,
that is, featherwise. The stipules, which are found at the base
of the leaf-stalk in many plants, are in this genus converted into
sharp spines. The flowers, of similar pea-shape to those of the
Laburnum, are white and fragrant. They are in long loose
racemes, which droop from the axils of the leaves in May. The
legumes are very thin, and of a dark-brown hue.</p>

<p>This was one of the first American trees introduced to
Europe, and its name of Locust came with it, the missionaries
believing it must be the tree upon whose fruit, with the addition<!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
of wild honey, John the Baptist supported himself in the wilderness.
It is also known as Silver Chain, in contradistinction to
the Gold Chain or Laburnum; also as White Laburnum.</p>

<h3>The Larch (<i>Larix europ&aelig;a</i>).</h3>

<p>An enormous number of exotic Coniferous trees are at the
present time commonly grown in our parks and pleasure grounds,
and even our woods show a considerable variety beyond the
Scots Pine and Yew that Nature has alone given us as timber
trees in this order. To attempt to give even a very brief
account of all these in a pocket volume, in addition to almost
the entire woody Flora indigenous to these islands, would be
manifestly absurd. We can, however, deal with a few representative
species of these exotics, and we give the Larch the
first place by reason of its present plentifulness in extensive
unmixed woods and plantations.</p>

<p>The Larch is naturally a tree of the mountains, and ascends
to a greater elevation even than the Spruce Fir. Unmixed
forests of Larch in the Bavarian Alps occur between 3000 and
6000 feet above sea-level, and on the central Swiss Alps it
ascends to nearly 7000 feet. A long winter of real cold is
necessary for its full development and the ripening of its wood,
and for that reason the timber of Larch grown in England is
inferior to that grown in its native countries, because our
winters are either short or mild, and neither gives the tree the
full rest it needs. It is a European tree, and was introduced&mdash;though
not in any numbers&mdash;to England at some date prior to
1629. For 150 years it appears to have been cultivated here
merely as an ornamental garden tree. Then attention was
called to its value as a timber tree, and the Society of Arts
offered gold medals for Larch planting and essays upon its
economic importance. Already (1728) the second Duke of
Atholl had begun those experiments in Larch growing for<!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
timber which have been continued by his successors on a vast
scale, the fourth Duke planting 27,000,000 Larch-trees on
15,000 acres of barren land. Their example has been copied on
a smaller scale all over the country.</p>

</div>

<p>The Larch is a lofty tree, with a very straight tapering trunk<!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
ordinarily attaining a length between 80 and 100 feet, but under
very favourable conditions 120 feet, with a girth of bole from
6 to 12 feet. The brown bark is easily separable into thin
layers, and the growth of the tree causes it to split into deep
longitudinal fissures. The long lower branches are spreading,
with a downward tendency, and the tips turned upward again.
The twigs are mostly pendulous, and bear long and slender
light-green leaves, in bundles of thirty or forty. All the other
families of Coniferous trees are evergreen, their leaves lasting for
several years; but at the beginning of winter the Larch leaves
wither and fall, and the Larch-wood takes on a more lifeless
aspect than is assumed by any of our native trees in their leafless
condition. But in spring, when the fresh green leaves are just
showing in spreading tufts, and the reddish-purple female flowers&mdash;Tennyson's
"rosy plumelets"&mdash;hang brightly from the gaunt
branches, the Larch wears an entirely different appearance, and
in summer the light grace of branches and foliage makes the
Larch a beautiful object. That is, one should say, the trees
that grow on the very outer edge of the wood, or, better still, one
that has been planted as a specimen tree, where it has room to
fling out its arms on all sides without touching anything, and
can get the abundant light it needs. The straight rows in the
plantation, with every tree at an equal distance from its neighbours,
and its lower branches dead, may be very pretty from the
timber-merchant's point of view, but one likes to think of the tree
as a living thing of beauty rather than as a detail in a factory
where scaffold-poles and telegraph-posts are being grown to
regulation size and shape.</p>

<p>The brown cones are egg-shaped, little more than an inch in
length, the scales with loose edges. The wood is very durable,
and it has the great recommendation of being fit for ordinary
use when the tree is only forty years old. It is most valuable
for those purposes where exposure to all weathers is a necessity,
for it endures constant change from wet to dry. Larch-bark is<!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
used for tanning, and Venice turpentine is a product of the tree.
Unlike most Conifers, it has the power of sending out new
shoots when the branches have been removed close up to the
stem.</p>

<p>Larch plantations sometimes present the appearance of death
whilst they are still covered with foliage, but the leaves are
yellow and twisted. This most frequently occurs in the case of
trees between the ages of ten and fourteen years, and is due to
the depredations of a leaf-mining caterpillar, which ultimately
changes into a minute moth, the Larch-miner (<i>Coleophora
laricella</i>). It feeds in the interior of the Larch-needles, and
therefore is beyond the reach of destruction, except by felling
and burning affected trees, to prevent the spread of the pest.
Its ravages keep the tree in ill-health, and apparently prepare
the way for the deadly attack of another small enemy, known
as the Larch Canker&mdash;the fungus <i>Peziza willkommii</i>. Sickly
trees are also liable to the attentions of a Wood-wasp (<i>Sirex
juvencus</i>), whose appearance is usually the cause of a little
terror in nervous persons. It has two pairs of smoky transparent
wings, and its stout, straight, blue body terminates in a
long slender point. Its large white grub spends two or three
years tunnelling towards the heart of the tree and out to the
bark again, but rarely attacks sound trees. It sometimes
makes its appearance in a house from wood that has been used
for building purposes.</p>

<h3>The Silver Fir (<i>Abies pectinata</i>).</h3>

<p>Evelyn has left on record the fact that a two-year-old
specimen of the Silver Fir was planted in Harefield Park,
near Uxbridge, in the year 1603, and this is usually regarded
as the date of its introduction to England, though the evidence
is by no means conclusive. Its home is in the mountain
regions of Central and Southern Europe. Its highest range<!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
appears to be on the Pyrenees, where it is found at an elevation
of 6500 feet, forming pure forests of considerable area.
Specimens have been recorded in Southern Germany that have
attained a height of nearly 200 feet, but in this country a more
usual stature is from 100 to 120 feet, with a bole girth between
10 and 15 feet. Its trunk is straight and erect, tapering gently,
and covered with smooth bark, of a greyish-brown colour,
which in aged specimens becomes rugged and fissured longitudinally,
as shown in our photo, and of a silvery grey colour.
It retains its lower branches for a period of forty to fifty years,
but after that age they begin to fall off. Whilst the tree is
growing up&mdash;which is, roughly speaking, during its first two
hundred years&mdash;the crown forms a slender bush; but its vertical
growth completed, the crown grows laterally, and becomes flat-topped.
Its life-period covers about four hundred years.<!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

A, cone.</span>
</div>

<p>The leaves are flat and slender, not in bundles, as in the
Scots Pine, but arranged along the branchlets in two or three
dense ranks. They are dark, rich green above, about an inch
long, and on the flattened underside there is a bluish-white
stripe on each side of the midrib, which gives a silvery appearance
to the foliage when upturned, as is usual on the
fertile branches. These leaves endure from six to nine years.
The flowers appear in May at the tips of the branches. The
male flowers are about three-quarters of an inch long, and consist
of two or three series of overlapping scales, enclosing the yellow
stamens. The cones are cylindrical, with a blunt top, always
erect, 6 to 8 inches long, and from 1&frac14; to 2 inches in diameter. On
the back of each of the broad scales there is a long, slender,
pointed bract, which extends beyond the scale and turns downward.
At first these cones are green, then become reddish, and
when mature are brown; but maturity is not reached until
eighteen months after their appearance. The angular seeds are
furnished with a broad wing twice their length. They are shed
by the cones in the spring following their maturity, the scales
falling at the same time and leaving the core of the cone on
the tree.</p>

<p>As a rule, the tree does not produce fertile seeds until it is
about forty years of age, but seedless cones are formed from
its twentieth year. Although the flowers of both sexes are
found on the same tree, it may be that for a series of years
only cones are produced. Until the Silver Fir is about twelve
years old its growth is slow, and its annual increase is only
a few inches, but later it will be as many feet. During this
early stage spring frosts often destroy the leader-shoot, but
its place is taken by another shoot; and soon the symmetry
of the tree is restored. If this occurs at a later stage, however,
the tree bears evidence of it in a forked trunk. It is a
deep-rooting species, with a branching tap-root, and succeeds
best in an open soil that is moist without being wet.</p>

<p>The timber, which has an irregular grain, is strong, and
does not warp; but it is soft, and not enduring where it is
exposed to the weather. It is yellowish-white in colour, and
is largely used for all interior work.</p>

<h3>The Spruce Fir (<i>Picea excelsa</i>).</h3>

<p>Although we are compelled to class the Spruce among introduced
species, it can lay claim to have been one of the older
forest trees of Britain, for the upper beds of the Tertiary
formations contain abundant evidence that the Spruce was a
native here when those strata were laid down. Of its modern
introduction there is no record, but from mention of it by Turner
in his "Names of Herbes in Greke, Latin, Englishe, etc.," we
know that it was at some date anterior to the publication of that
work (1548). It is widely distributed as a native tree throughout
the continent of Europe, with the exception of Denmark and
Holland. It is the principal forest tree on the elevated tracts of
Germany and Switzerland, and on the central Alpine ranges it
reaches an altitude of 6500 feet. It is an extremely variable
tree, but we cannot here deal with the varieties beyond saying
that two principal forms, different in habit and in timber, are
outwardly distinguished by one having red, the other green,
cones.</p>

<p>The Spruce Fir is a tall and graceful tree with tapering trunk,
120 to 150 feet in height, though in this country its more usual
stature, when full-grown, would be about 80 feet high, with a
bole circumference of about 9 feet. At first covered with
thin, smooth, warm-brown bark, in later life this breaks up into
irregular scales, thin layers of which are cast off. Instead of a
bushy crown, such as we see in the Silver Fir, the Spruce ends
in a delicate spire, so familiar in the Christmas-tree, which is a
Spruce Fir in the nursery stage. The branches are in very<!-- Page 156 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
regular tiers from base to summit, and the branchlets go off
almost opposite each other, densely clothed with the short
grass-green needles. These are from a half to three-quarters of
an inch in length, four-sided, and ending in a fine sharp point.
They endure for six or seven years.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i_320.jpg"><img src="images/i_320_tn.jpg" width="400" height="325" alt="Spruce Fir." title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Spruce Fir.</span>
</div>

<p>The flowers are produced near the ends of last year's shoots,
those with stamens being borne singly or in clusters of two or
three. They are about three-quarters of an inch in length, and
of a yellow colour, tinged with pink. The cones, which hang
downwards, are almost cylindrical, about 5 inches long and 1&frac12;
inches in diameter. The pale brown scales are thin, and loosely
overlap. The seeds, of which there are two under each scale,
are very small, with a transparent brown wing, five times the<!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
length of the seed. The flowers appear in May, and the seeds
are not ripe until nearly a year later.</p>

<p>The tree is a shallow rooter, the roots going off horizontally
in all directions a little below the surface, and becoming intimately
matted with those of neighbouring trees. This surface-rooting
often leads to disaster in plantations and forests of
Spruce, for it is least able of all the firs to withstand a gale,
which will sometimes make a broad avenue through the plantation
by toppling the trees one against another.</p>

<p>The wood of the Spruce Fir, though light, is even grained,
elastic, and durable, and the straightness of its stem makes it
very valuable for all purposes where great length and straightness
are required, as for the masts of small vessels, ladders, scaffolding,
telegraph-poles; as well as for the varied uses the builder
finds for its planks. It supplies resin and pitch, and most of
the cheaper periodicals now issued largely owe their existence
to the Spruce, for its fibres reduced to pulp are made into the
paper upon which they are printed. Although its growth during
the first few years is rather slow, progress during the next
twenty-five years is tolerably rapid, being at the rate of two
or three feet per year, if in a favourable situation, and on
moist light soil. When grown in a wood the Spruce loses
its lower branches early, but when given sufficient "elbow-room,"
these remain to a good old age, so that from spire to
earth the graceful cone of bright green is continuous.</p>

<p>The name Spruce is from the German <i>sprossen</i> (a sprout),
in allusion to the numerous short branchlets that are a
characteristic of the tree.</p>

<h3>The Douglas Fir (<i>Pseudotsuga douglasii</i>).</h3>

<p>Although the name of this tree in English and Latin might
reasonably lead one to suppose that David Douglas, the intrepid
botanical explorer, was the discoverer of it, that is not really so.<!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
It was Archibald Menzies who first made it known to science,
by means of herbarium specimens collected in 1792, when, as
the companion of Vancouver, he visited the western coasts of
North America. But Douglas, in his capacity of collector to
the Royal Horticultural Society, landed at Fort Vancouver on
the Columbia River in 1825, and not only sent home herbarium
specimens, but seeds also, of this and several previously
unknown Conifers. It was by means of these seeds that the
Douglas Fir was introduced to Britain. It was already known
by Lambert's name of <i>Abies taxifolia</i>, but Dr. Lindley, a short
time previous to Douglas' untimely death, selected the tree as
a suitable and enduring memorial of the enormous services
Douglas had rendered, and named it <i>Abies douglasii</i>. Since
then Carrière has split up the old genus <i>Abies</i> and placed
<i>douglasii</i> in the new genus <i>Pseudotsuga</i>.</p>

<p>Under the most favourable natural conditions, as around
Puget Sound and on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada,
the Douglas Fir grows to a height of 300 feet, with a girth of
30 to 40 feet, but on the drier slopes of the Rocky Mountains it
is not more than 100 feet high. In Colorado, forests of Douglas
Fir are found at an elevation of 11,000 feet. The tree has not
been sufficiently long established in this country to say what
dimensions it will reach, though it appears to have taken kindly
to Ireland and to Devon and Cornwall, where the rate of growth
of young trees is about 30 inches per annum. There are plenty
of trees in these islands, planted about the year 1834, which
have reached or passed 100 feet, and there is no doubt that
towards our western coasts this height will be greatly exceeded.
Some of these trees have long since produced cones, and from
their seeds many young trees have been raised.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">Douglas Fir.
<br />
A, female flower; B, male flower.</span>
</div>

<p>The Douglas Fir is of pyramidal outline, with the lowest
branches bending to the ground under their weight of branchlets
and leaves; above, they spread horizontally, but the uppermost
are more or less ascending. The branchlets are given off mostly<!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
in opposite pairs, densely clothed with slender, rich green leaves,
&frac34; to 1&frac14; inches in length, paler beneath. They endure for six or
seven years, and are arranged in three or four ranks. The male
flowers will be found clustered at intervals on the underside of
the previous year's shoots, whilst the cones are formed at the
tips of the lateral branchlets, and hang downwards. These
cones are somewhat elliptical in outline, from 2&frac12; to 4 inches
long, with large scales, and from the back of each there extends<!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
a three-clawed bract, whereof the middle claw or awn is very
long. Several well-marked varieties of the Douglas Fir are also
to be met with occasionally in parks and gardens.</p>

<p>The Douglas Fir produces excellent timber, and is a most
valuable forest tree, not only on that account, but because of its
adaptability to varying conditions of soil and climate. It is
the most widely distributed of all American forest trees, and
the area of its distribution is spread over thirty-two degrees of
latitude, and from end to end of this range it has, in the words
of Sargent, "to endure the fierce gales and long winters of the
north, and the nearly perpetual sunshine of the Mexican
Cordilleras; to thrive in the rain and fog which sweep almost
continuously along the Pacific coast range, and on the arid
mountain slopes of the interior, where for months every year
rain never falls." It appears to thrive best where the air is
humid and the soil well drained. It begins to bear cones about
its twenty-fifth year. The straight tapering trunk is largely
used for the masts and spars of ships, its suitability for this
purpose being evident to all visitors to Kew who have gazed at
the flag-staff set up in the arboretum. This pole is 159 feet
long, with a circumference of 6 feet at the base, tapering to
2 feet 2 inches at the top, and weighing about 3 tons. It was
brought from Vancouver Island, and an examination of its rings
before it was set up showed that it represented the growth of
about 250 years. The full life of the Douglas Fir is estimated
to be about 750 years.</p>

<h3>The Stone Pine (<i>Pinus pinea</i>).</h3>

<span class="caption">Stone Pine, cone and leaves.</span>
</div>

<p>Between the tall, graceful spire of the Douglas Fir and the
squat, heavy, umbrella-like head of the Stone Pine, there is an
enormous contrast. It must be confessed that the Stone Pine
is less beautiful than picturesque, a point that strongly commends
it to the landscape painter working in the countries bordering<!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the Mediterranean, in which region it is native. The date of
its introduction to Britain is not known, but it has been in cultivation
here certainly for more than three centuries and a half,
for Turner mentions it in his "Names of Herbes in Greke, Latin,
Englishe, Duch, and Frenche," published in 1548. In its native
countries it attains a height of sixty to eighty feet, but in this
country the finest examples are only about thirty-five feet,
whilst ordinary British-grown examples are only half that
height. Its trunk, covered with rugged, and deeply fissured,
thick, red-grey bark, forks at no great distance from the roots,<!-- Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
and sends off massive spreading branches of great length. For
several years the young tree produces short single leaves, but
later leaves are five or six inches long, slender, and of a bright
green tint, in pairs, united at their base by a pale sheath. These
leaves endure for two or three years. The pollen-bearing flowers
are crowded into a spike. The female flowers are about three-quarters
of an inch long, composed of pale greenish scales.
After fertilization, these grow to a length of four to six inches,
of a rugged oval form and red-brown colour, ripening in the
third year. The scales of these cones are somewhat wedge-shaped,
with a stout rhomboid boss, which has a depression
round the central protuberance. The seeds, which are eaten for
dessert and preserved as sweetmeats in the countries where the
Stone Pine is native, are enclosed in a bony shell, and it is from
this circumstance that the tree gets its name.</p>

<span class="caption">Austrian Pine.</span>
</div>

<p>What is known as the Austrian Pine is a variety of the
Corsican or Larch Pine, and its botanical name correctly set
out is <i>Pinus laricio</i>, var. <i>austriaca</i>. The name has reference to
the fact that its chief home as an indigenous tree is in the
southern provinces of the Austrian Empire. The range of the
type and its varieties together includes Central and Southern
Europe, and part of Western Asia. It is a comparatively recent
addition to our sylva in both forms, for the type was introduced
in 1759, in the belief that it was a maritime form of the Scots
Pine, but the variety <i>austriaca</i> was first sent out by Lawson and
Son, the Edinburgh nurserymen, in 1835.</p>

<p>The typical species (Corsican Pine) is a slender tree of
somewhat pyramidal form, growing to the height of 80 to 120
feet. The Austrian Pine, though a large tree, is of smaller
proportions&mdash;from 60 to 80 feet high&mdash;but with stouter and<!-- Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
longer branches, and denser foliage. The leaves, which vary
from three to five inches in length, are sheathed in pairs, convex
on the outer side, rigid, glossy, dark green, and with toothed
margins. The cone is conical (!), with a rounded base, two to
three inches in length, and its position on the branch is almost
horizontal, the scales somewhat similar to those of the Scots
Pine, but with stronger bosses, and of a yellowish-brown colour,<!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
polished. It takes about seventeen months to become full
grown and ripen the seeds.</p>

<p>The Austrian Pine is one of those that do well on poor soils,
and takes kindly to chalk. From the density of its foliage, it
makes a good shade and shelter tree. Its timber, though
coarse in grain, is very durable, and useful for outside work.</p>

Cedar of Lebanon.</span>
</div>


<h3>Cedar of Lebanon (<i>Cedrus libani</i>).</h3>

<p>Made familiar, by name at least, from very early times by
frequent references to it in the books of the Old Testament, it
is rather strange that so hardy a tree was not one of the
first of those introduced for ornament into Britain. It is true
that local legends attaching to some old Cedars in this country
credit them with having been planted in "the spacious times of
great Elizabeth"&mdash;as the great Cedar at Whitton, Middlesex,
blown down in 1779; but, on the other hand, we have the fact
that no mention is made of the Cedar by John Evelyn in his
"Sylva" (1664). This, it is true, is only negative evidence; but
it is strong none the less, for it is not at all likely that so keen
and pious an arboriculturist would have omitted mention of so
noteworthy a tree had such been growing here when he wrote.
There is reason to believe, however, that the still-existing Enfield
Cedar was planted about the date of Evelyn's publication
by Dr. Uvedale, master of the Enfield Grammar School.</p>

<p>The researches of Sir J. D. Hooker, subsequent to his
memorable expedition to Lebanon and Taurus in 1860, established
the specific identity of the three Cedars known as the
Mount Atlas Cedar, the Cedar of Lebanon, and the Deodar.
Though the arboriculturist still treats them as distinct species,
they are scientifically regarded as geographical forms of one
species. For convenience we here adopt the arboriculturist's
view.</p>

<p>The Cedar varies greatly&mdash;no tree more so&mdash;in height and<!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
general outline, according to situation and environment, and
though the stature of well-grown trees in this country may be
correctly stated as from 50 to 80 feet, we are not without
examples of 100 and 120 feet where the conditions have been
specially favourable. There is one of 120 feet at Strathfieldsaye,
and among the numerous fine Cedars at Goodwood there is the
celebrated Great Cedar, 90 feet high, with a bole 25 feet in
circumference, and a broad conical head whose base has a
diameter of 130 feet. But the Cedar, as usually seen on lawns
and in parks, has a low, rounded, or flattened top, the great
spreading arms having grown more rapidly than the trunk.
Thus grown, the huge bole has seldom any great length, throwing
out these timber branches at from six to ten feet from the
ground, and immediately afterwards the trunk is divided into
several stems. From these the main branches take a curving<!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
direction, at first ascending, but the part furthest from the
trunk becoming almost horizontal. It is chiefly at the extremity
of the branches that the branchlets and leaves are produced.</p>

<p>The evergreen leaves last for three, four, or five years, and
are of needle-shape, varying in length from a little less to a little
more than an inch. They are produced in a similar manner to
those of the Larch&mdash;in tufts that are arranged spirally round
dwarf shoots, mostly on the upper side of the branchlets. The
male flowers are to be found at the extremity of branchlets
which, though six or seven years old, are very short, their
development having been arrested. The solid, purple-brown
cones are only three or four inches long, broad-topped, and
with a diameter of about half the length; the scales thin and
closely pressed together; they are at first greyish-green, tinged
with pink. The development and maturity of these cones takes
two or three seasons, and they remain on the tree for several
years longer. The seeds are angular, with a wedge-shaped
wing.</p>

<p>The trees do not produce cones until they are from twenty-five
to thirty years old; but they may be a century old before
producing either male or female flowers.</p>

<p>The trunk is covered with thick, rough, deeply fissured bark.
On the branches the bark is smooth, and peels off in thin flakes.
The Cedar, in its native habitat, produces admirable timber, but
that of trees grown in our own country is described by Loudon
as "reddish-white, light and spongy, easily worked, but very apt
to shrink and warp, and by no means durable." For these
reasons the tree is grown almost solely for ornament.</p>

<p>The name Cedar is supposed to be derived from the Arabic
<i>kedroum</i>, or <i>kèdre</i> (power), and has reference to its majestic
proportions and strong timber.<!-- Page 167 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

Deodar.</span>
</div>


<h3>The Deodar, or Indian Cedar (<i>Cedrus deodara</i>).</h3>

<p>Although, as we have indicated, the differences between the
Cedar of Lebanon and the Cedar of Himalaya are not such as
can be scientifically accepted as constituting specific distinctness,
they are sufficient to at once strike the ordinary observer.
In proportion to the height of the trunk, for example, the main
branches are much shorter, the result being a more regular
pyramidal outline, terminating in a light spire. The terminal
shoots of the branches are longer, more slender, and quite
pendulous. These differences, though really slight, transform
the rather heavy majesty of the Cedar, as represented by <i>C.
libani</i>, into one of graceful beauty. Although the experience of
sixty years has sadly falsified the high hopes entertained as to
the suitability of the Deodar for cultivation in this country as a
timber tree, its value for ornamental purposes and in landscape

</div>

<p>The headquarters of the Deodar are in the mountains of
north-west India, where it forms forests at various altitudes
above 3500 feet. Its vertical distribution, indeed, extends to
a height of 12,000 feet, but its principal habitat lies between
6000 and 10,000 feet. Deodar timber produced in its native
forests is exceedingly durable, being compact and even grained,
not liable to warp or split, and standing the test of being
alternately wet and dry. Loudon states that when a building,
which had been erected by the Emperor Akbar in the latter
part of the sixteenth century, was pulled down between 1820 and
1825, the Deodar timber used in its construction was found to be
so sound that it was again used in building a house for Rajah
Shah. And Brandis tells of very much more ancient bridges in
Srunagar, whose piers are of Deodar wood, and appear to be
as yet unaffected by decay.</p>

<p>It is to the Hon. W. L. Melville that we are indebted for the
introduction of the Deodar to Britain in 1831, and during the<!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
next ten years many young trees were raised here from seeds.
Favourably impressed by the rapidity of growth of these seedlings,
the government, fearing a coming shortage of Oak for naval
purposes, imported and distributed large numbers of Deodar
seeds, and high estimates were formed of the future value of
these trees. But in framing these estimates one important
factor was omitted&mdash;the uncertainty of the British climate, with
its rapid changes, "everything by turns, and nothing long." A
score or two of years served to demonstrate that such conditions
were opposed to the longevity and uniform development that
produced sound timber on the Indian mountains; and to-day
the Deodar is not mentioned among the trees that are to bring<!-- Page 169 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
riches to the British timber grower. In spite of this failure,
there are to be seen in many parts of these islands fine
young Deodars of forty or fifty years, and from fifty to seventy
feet in height.</p>

<p>There is no necessity for repeating the particulars already
given respecting the Cedar of Lebanon, and which apply to the
Deodar with such modifications as are indicated in the first
paragraph above. Specimens grown where they have sufficient
space for spreading out their long arms, retain their branches to
the base of the trunk, and if these are cut off they can reproduce
them. Several nursery varieties&mdash;with golden (<i>aurea</i>), silvery
(<i>argentea</i>), or more intense green (<i>viridis</i>) foliage than the type&mdash;have
appeared as a result of European cultivation.</p>

Lawson&#39;s Cypress.</span>
</div>


<h3>Lawson's Cypress (<i>Cupressus lawsoniana</i>).</h3>

<p>Lawson's Cypress belongs to that section of Conifers which
includes the Junipers and Thuias, and is a representative of the
North American Sylva. It is a native of South Oregon and
North California, where it is believed to have been first discovered
by Jeffrey, about 1852. Two years later seeds were received by
Messrs. Lawson, the Edinburgh nurserymen, from Mr. William
Murray, and from these seeds were raised the first young trees
of this species sent out by the firm. The name was bestowed
in honour of Mr. Charles Lawson, the then head of the firm,
and by this name it is generally known in Europe, but in the
United States it is the Port Orford Cypress. At Port Orford, on
the Oregon coast, according to Sargent, "it forms one of the
most prolific and beautiful coniferous forests of the continent,
unsurpassed in the variety and luxuriance of its undergrowth
of Rhododendrons, Vacciniums, Raspberries, Buckthorns, and
Ferns," and any one who has seen well-grown specimens in the
pleasure-grounds of this country can easily realize something of
the beauty of such a forest, though allowance has to be made<!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
for the fact that in forest growth the lower branches are lost at
an early age.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i_346.jpg"><img src="images/i_346_tn.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="Lawson Cypress." title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Lawson Cypress.</span>
</div>

<p>In its native home the Lawson Cypress attains a height
of between 120 and 150 feet, occasionally reaching 200 feet,
with a base circumference of 40 feet. The thick brown
bark splits into rounded scaly ridges. The short horizontal
branches divide a good deal towards their leafy extremities,
which are curved, and commonly drooping. The leaves are
little evergreen scales, which overlap, and being closely pressed
to the branchlet, completely clothe and hide it. They are bright
dark-green in colour, and endure for three or four years. The
male flowers are produced at the tips of short branchlets, formed<!-- Page 171 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
a year earlier. They are of cylindric form, crimson in colour,
and each stamen bears from two to six anther-cells. The small
"cones" are more or less globular, but instead of a large number
of spirally arranged overlapping scales, as in the Pines and Firs,
here there are only eight, whose edges at first join to form a
box. When the "cone" is ripe these scales separate, to allow
the escape of the seeds.</p>

<p>The Lawson Cypress produces a valuable wood, close-grained
and strong, yet light. It is considered one of the most important
timber trees of North America; but in this country it
has been planted solely with a view to its ornamental qualities.
Its perfect hardiness and its freedom of growth may, with longer
experience than half a century affords, lead to its being regarded
as a timber producer here also.</p>

<p>The Common Cypress (<i>Cupressus sempervirens</i>) of the Mediterranean
region and the East, of which poets have sung in
all ages, has been cultivated in this country for at least three
hundred and fifty years.</p>

<h3>The Chili Pine (<i>Araucaria imbricata</i>).</h3>

<p>The Chili Pine, or "Monkey Puzzle," is a familiar sight on
suburban lawns, where, however, it seldom attains a large size
or long retains health. The lower branches drop off, and the
upper ones become brown, as though scorched. But away from
the smoke-laden atmosphere and uncongenial soils, some handsome
and massive Araucarias may be seen rising from fair lawns,
with dense branches curving at their tips, and regularly disposed
in whorls from the dome-like head of the tree to the grass
at its base. Such was the magnificent specimen at Dropmore
that died in 1902, such is the fine tree at Woodstock, Co.
Kilkenny, which now presumably takes the position of eminence
in these islands hitherto held by the Dropmore example.<!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chili Pine is a native of Southern Chili, where it was
discovered by a Spaniard, Don F. Dendariarena, in 1780, as he
was prospecting for timber. About the same time two other
Spaniards, Drs. Ruiz and Pavon, were botanizing in Chili, and
came across the Araucaria, of which they sent herbarium specimens
to Europe. But in spite of this three-fold opportunity for
Spain, the actual introduction of the Araucaria to Europe must
be credited to Britain. Archibald Menzies, who accompanied
Captain Vancouver as botanist on his celebrated voyage, came
across the tree in Chili, and brought home both seeds and<!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
young plants. One of these became a fine tree at Kew, where it
was for many years the object of admiration and interest, but it
perished in 1892.</p>

<br />
A, seed, with attached wing.</span>
</div>

<p>The Araucaria forms extensive pure forests in the province of
Arauco, from which it gets its name, and to whose inhabitants
the seeds are a most important item of their food-supply. Not
only do the trees in these forests lose their lower branches, but
even those growing in the open plains of their native country
have similarly bare trunks for nearly half their height. It is
therefore a satisfaction to know that the finest specimens grown
in this country have really surpassed those grown in their natural
home. The height reached by old trees is from eighty to a
hundred feet, with a trunk-girth of from sixteen to twenty-three
feet. The tapering of this trunk is very slight, and a few of the stiff,
spine-tipped leaves, with which its younger extremity is densely
clothed, still remain attached in a dried-up condition far down
the column. These leaves will have been observed to entirely
cover the branches, not being restricted, as in most trees, to the
newly formed branchlets and twigs. They are very hard, and
endure for about fifteen years; are about an inch and a quarter
long, and overlap, though their sharp-pointed ends turn away
from the branch.</p>

<p>The cylindrical male flowers are four or five inches long, borne
singly or in small clusters. It was formerly supposed that the sexes
were on separate trees, but though many individuals only produce
flowers of one kind, this is by no means the general rule. The
female flowers are about four inches long, almost round in
shape, but broader at the base than above. They are covered
with long, narrow, overlapping scales, beneath which are found
the seeds when the flower has developed into the brown cone,
which is six inches in diameter. The scales are then easily
detached; in fact, when the seeds are ripe, the cone falls to
pieces. The seed is about an inch and a half long, enclosed
in a hard, thin shell.<!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chili Pine does not succeed in this country unless it is
given pure air, sunshine, abundant moisture, and an open subsoil
to carry it off. Yet it will grow to a very handsome tree
if these conditions are observed. Very fine effects have been
obtained in some places by planting an Araucaria grove. Such
an avenue is in fine condition at Woodstock, Co. Kilkenny
(running parallel with an avenue of <i>Abies nobilis</i>), every tree
with its branches intact from turf to summit, and bearing
fertile cones. There is a similar, but less perfectly preserved,
Araucaria grove at Bicton in Devonshire.</p>
